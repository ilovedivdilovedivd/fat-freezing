<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><i>How soon before next Coolsculpting session</i></p><p>Coolsculpting treatment plan’s will vary from person to person and are created to address each person’s unique needs.</p><p>What one person does will always be different from the next person because everyone has a different body with different pockets of fat.</p><p>As a rule of thumb our clinic will do round 2 on any given area around the 6-8 week mark.</p><p>If someone has an upcoming event or if they have a lot of density that needs de-bulking several times before the sculpting phase, we may decide to re-treat as early as 4 weeks post treatment.</p><p>The Coolsculpting journey is as unique as the individual so it is very important that you and your technician openly discuss your treatment goals and lifestyle challenges in order to come up with the perfect plan to address your specific needs. (Marcia Fleming, MD, Vancouver Physician)</p><p>Coolsculpting sessions are made based on the number of cycles need for a particular area . You may need multiple cycles in order to cover one area for ex the abdomen, leg or flank . Treatments are done at least 6 weeks apart if multiple cycles per area is recommended. Final result normally is up to 3 months after treatments. (Joseph Doumit, MD, Montreal Dermatologist)</p><h3>What’s the area that bothers you the most?</h3><p>CoolSculpting is not as simple as having one treatment per area of opportunity. In fact, some people with more to lose have two or more “cycles” in a single session. For example there would be one placement in the midsection and then lateral to it.</p><p>That would make it 3 cycles for the belly area. Note that 20-25% of fat can be lost per treatment. For more appreciable results I suggest concentrating on the area that bothers you the most. How many applicators you can handle depends on your tolerance for discomfort and how many applicators your provider us.</p><p>Treatment times have decreased from one hour per cycle to about 35 minutes. And it is safe. (Justin Harper, MD, Columbus Physician)</p><p><strong>Time Between CoolSculpting Sessions</strong></p><p>I recommend waiting at least 6 weeks before re-treating the same area with CoolSculpting. The majority of fat cells that have been damaged with your first treatment will still be present if you treat the area too soon. (Michael Kerin, MD, New Rochelle Physician)</p><p>I would recommend waiting at least 4 weeks in between CoolSculpting treatment sessions.</p><p>It does take up to 12 weeks to see the results from a treatment, so there is no harm in waiting a longer period of time between treatments though. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Second CoolSculpting Treatment</i></p><p>Each provider may have their own protocol as to when they will re-treat a patient. I would recommend asking the person who is doing your first treatment what they recommend. At my practice, the earliest we will re-treat someone is one month after their first treatment.</p><p>If we already know more than 1 treatment are needed, we will go ahead and repeat it around 4-6 weeks after the first treatment. If we are unsure if a patient will even need a second treatment, we would wait approx.</p><p>2-3 months to have a better idea of the result achieved from the first treatment. It can take 2-3 months to see the final result, so we prefer to first determine if a second treatment is even needed. (Shamim Shakibai, MD, Los Angeles Physician)</p><p><i>Coolsculpting Treatment </i></p><p>I am happy to hear that your treatment was effective. As to how long to wait to schedule the next appointment it all depends on what your treatment plan was. Here at Refined Dermatology we assess patients and create a treatment plan that includes re-treatment if necessary.</p><p>Most people will require additional treatments to get to their desired results. We typically see people 4 to 6 weeks after their initial treatment. (Steven Swengel, MD, Los Gatos Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>90 CoolSculpting follow up</h3><p>I see patients at 90 days for a follow-up evaluation. If you wish to have your treatment prior to then please contact your plastic surgeon’s office to discuss the timing. (Christine Sullivan, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Timing of Second Cool Sculpt Treatment</h5><p>In my practice our RN’s do follow up photos at 90 days. Ofter times that is when clients decide on additonal treatments or not. However, some clients choose to move forward with a repeat treatment sooner if we know the volume will warrant more than one treatment or the client wants a result by a certain target date.</p><p>Zeltiq recommends waiting at least 30 days to repeat a site. With that being said, you can see changes up to that 90 day period so perhaps it’s best to wait, but if you’re happy and know you want to repeat it at 4-6 weeks it is safe. (Robert Heck, MD, FACS, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I would wait until the full effects of the first treatment have been achieved before moving forward with additional treatments. (Brian Biesman, MD, Nashville Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Correct Time For A Second CoolSculpting Treatment</strong></p><p>20-25% fat reduction is just an average. We have had some patients who have had more than 25% reduction and we have had some with less. Those who are extremely active with good eating habits usually get better results.</p><p>We have been getting great results with chest treatments, but most patients will need between 2-3 treatments for optimal results. We space treatments out between 6-12 weeks apart. Personally, I wouldn’t retreat anyone earlier than 4-6 weeks. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><p><i>Scheduling of second CoolSculpting treatment</i></p><p>I have found it can take 3-4 months to see the full effect from a CoolSculpting treatment. The timing of having a second treatment is really up to the treating physician. I have done a second treatment as soon as one month after the first, but my preference is to wait at least 2 months in between treatments.</p><p>The physician treating you may feel differently. In my opinion, the results should not be affected if you have the second treatment sooner rather than later. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Ideal time between CoolSculpting sessions</em></p><p>Patients can retreat the same area as soon as 4-6 weeks after the first treatment as long as the post treatment healing is complete. In some cases where a second treatment is a possibility but not certain or in cases where the treatment plan is expected to change (i.e., the placement of applicators or type of applicators) then an 8-12 wait is probably best. (Manish Khanna, MD, FRCP(C), Montreal Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Wait between coolsculpting sessions</em></p><p>I think every practice has their own time intervals but on an average I recommend waiting at least 8 weeks after first application, before the second application in same area is applied and sometimes patients want to wait full 12 weeks before the second application. (Ramandeep Sidhu, MD, Issaquah Vascular Surgeon)</p><p>We have found that patients can be retreated in the range of 4-6 weeks after the first application. What is most important is that any initial swelling and numbness have completely subsided before retreating. We have successfully treated tens of thousands of patients with Coolsculpting, and most of our patients retreat after one month.</p><p>This allows the patient to get the final results much sooner than if they waited an unnecessarily long period between treatments. Keep in mind that it is absolutely not necessary to wait until full results, or any noticeable results, are seen prior to a second application in the same area. (Edward Stokes, MD, West Hollywood Physician)</p><p><strong>Treatment Timing</strong></p><p>The legs can sometimes take the longest to see full results from Coolsculpting. So most providers will recommend waiting the full 8 to 12 weeks. You’re starting point can also be a determining factor.</p><p>However, If you still have concerns you should speak with your physician about waiting longer. (Janet Allenby, DO, Delray Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Timing between CoolSculpting treatment sessions</em></p><p>It would be fine to retreat an area with CoolSculpting 6 weeks later, but there is no harm in waiting a longer period of time. Some people prefer to treat sooner rather than later so that they can reach their goal sooner.</p><p>Some people may want to wait a longer period of time to see the full effect from the first treatment, which can take up to 12 weeks. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
