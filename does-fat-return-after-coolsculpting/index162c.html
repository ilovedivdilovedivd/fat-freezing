<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>When CoolSculpting is done to a particular area of the body, it normally will cause a percentage of the fat cells in that area to be destroyed over time. Once those fat cells are destroyed, they will not come back. If someone who was treated gains weight, the fat cells in the body can enlarge. This includes the fat cells that remain in the treated area as well. So, the results are not temporary if weight is maintained. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>New fat cells following CoolSculpting</h4><p>It is currently believed that following adolescence, fat cells stop multiplying (hyperplasia) but will grow in size (hypertrophy). Each of us is genetically pre-determined to increase or decrease fat volume differently.</p><p>Men tend to be “apples” with fat growth around the organs of the tummy and women tend to become “pears” with fat growth in the hips and thigh but there is quite a variation among individuals.</p><p>Patients consider fat reduction in areas that will not genetically reduce in volume with dieting, such as the:</p><ul>
<li>love handles</li>
<li>breast</li>
<li>rolls</li>
<li>upper, middle and lower tummy</li>
<li>outer and inner thighs and knees</li>
<li>and many other areas.</li>
</ul><p>Once fat cells die with Coolsculpting or are removed with liposuction or excision, they will not return or multiply but the remaining cells in the area and cells in other areas of the body may grow in size with weight gain.</p><p>CoolSculpting effects are limited to the area within the cooling plates and up to a 20% reduction in fat volume. This leaves 80% of the fat cells to fill further.</p><p>Liposuction can reduce up to 80-90% of the fat cells leaving 10-20% of the fats cells to increase in volume. Surgical excision such as with a tummy tuck will remove 100% of the fat cells. You must consider eating less or increasing your calorie expenditure with exercise by the amount of fat lost from a procedure to maintain your weight. All these procedures are body contouring and not weight loss options. (Dean P. Kane, MD, FACS, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Permanent Result</h3><p>Fat cells that are eliminated from CoolSculpting are gone for good. Fat cells are receptacles for excess lipids that are not needed for energy. When you lose or gain weight, the volume of the fat cells change but the number of fat cells remain the same.</p><p>In order to appreciate and maintain the result from CoolSculpting, patients are recommended to maintain a healthy lifestyle through diet and exercise. Fat cell numbers are fairly set in adolescence. New fat cells can only be generated if they reach “critical cell size” which is typically when a person becomes severely obese. (Michael L. Workman, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Fat reduction permanent</strong></p><p>Once the fat cells die from the freezing during coolsculpting they do not regenerate or duplicate. However, not all of the fat cells are killed so if you gain weight the remaining fat cells will enlarge as usual.</p><p>As you gain weight your body will still be more uniform as we are targeting areas with excess fat to begin with.</p><p>It is a body contouring procedure, not a weight loss procedure but should be permanent if your weight is somewhat stable. (Josh Olson, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting selectively freezes fat cells to induce programmed cell death. The dead cells are removed by other cells in the body and studies have shown that the elevation of TG after a coolsculpting procedure is no greater than after consuming a single french fried potato. (Suzanne Kim Doud Galli, MD, PhD, FACS, Washington Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The frozen fat cells are engulfed inside of janitor cells called macrophages. They are not free-floating and do not increase trigliceride levels. (Sheila S. Nazarian, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>What Happens To Fat Cells After CoolSculpting</b></p><p>The fat cells that are frozen and killed during the CoolSculpting procedure are permanently eliminated from your body. They do not come back.</p><p>But, if you do not maintain a healthy diet and an active lifestyle or if you gain a significant amount of weight then the fat cells remaining in the area can always increase in size and lessen your results. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><p><em>Coolsculpting and Fat reduction</em></p><p>Coolsculpting is a great way of reducing a bulge in a given area. It works through a process of popsicle panniculitis whereby the fat cells are frozen and destroyed. These fat cells are eliminated from the body.</p><p>Coolsculpting is different from liposuction where the fat cells can recur in other areas of the body. For the most effective results please consult a board certified dermatologist with experience in Coolsculpting. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h5>CoolSculpting Won’t Cause Fat Accumulation Elsewhere</h5><p>The point to remember is that fat does not have a brain. Fat does not know to “go to other places because some fat cells were removed.” The fat cells that are destroyed by either CoolSculpting or liposuction will not return.</p><p>If you gain weight, the weight will be redistributed in all of the other fat cells in your body. If you are maintaining a steady weight at 2200 calories a day, then you will not gain weight if you remove fat cells.</p><p>Your metabolism is the same — you are enlarging the fat cells and reducing them at the same rate even though you have fewer fat cells in your body.</p><p>If you change your activity level or calorie intake or if your metabolism slows, then you will gain weight and all of the fat cells in your body will increase in size. (Louis C. Cutolo, Jr., MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting will eliminate approximately 20% of the fat cells in a treated area. If you maintain weight, then the post coolsculpting shape will be maintained. If you gain weight, you will gain in the areas that are typical for you.</p><p>The remaining fat cells in the treated area can grow or shrink depending on weight gain or loss. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Coolsculting and Fat</i></p><p>Coolsculpting is a fabulous procedure that freezes a bulge in a given area and minimizes the fat by between 15 and 20 percent in that area. The fat cells are removed gradually in the area and do not contribute to elevated triglyceride levels.</p><p>The frozen fat gets metabolized and excreted from the body over several months. These are excellent questions that were studied while coolsculpting was in development. For the best results please consult a board certified dermatologist with experience in coolsculpting. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p><strong>Number of coolsculpting treatments needed</strong></p><p>the number of coolsculpting treatments depends on the patient’s size and the amount of fat that needs to be treated. This varies among individuals</p><p>An average size abdomen is usually 4 small areas. The recommendation now it to repeat the treatment in 1 month.</p><p>An experienced provider will be able to assess you and determine the best plan for you to achieve your goals. (Jean M. Casello, MD, Northborough Physician)</p><p><i>Coolsculpting and abdomen</i></p><p>Coolsculpting is a great treatment option to get rid of stubborn fat, the #1 non-surgical procedure in the world. It is hard to know how many treatments you will need without an in-person assessment since the number of cycles needed for best results varies from person to person.</p><p>The good news is we can tailor treatments for your specific needs. It will be best to consult with a Coolsculpting certified practice for a proper consultation and treatment plan. (Alain Michon, MD, Ottawa Physician)</p><p>Treating the abdomen with Coolsculpting is one of the most popular treatments we do here at my office. The best way to know how many treatments will be required is to be assessed. We typically start with 2 to 4 applicators and most people need repeat treatments in a bout a month. (Steven Swengel, MD, Los Gatos Dermatologic Surgeon)</p></div>
