<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Coolsculpting is a non-surgical procedure with no downtime so you can return to normal activities right away.</p><p>Many people feel even more motivated after the coolsculpting treatments to exercise.</p><p>Working out and following a healthy diet will help to achieve a better result. (James Fernau, MD, FACS, Pittsburgh Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Exercise OK After CoolSculpting</em></p><p>CoolSculpting is popular due in part to the fact that it doesn’t require any notable downtime after treatment.</p><p>While you may be too sore to return to the gym the very same day, there are no restrictions on exercising the day after.</p><p>You don’t need to alter your routine in any way. (Richard Chaffoo, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>You can return to your workout routine immediately after CoolSculpting®.</h5><p>Since CoolSculpting® is completely non-invasive, there is no downtime or recovery period. Therefore, your activity will not be restricted at all. You could go to the gym directly from your CoolSculpting® treatment session if you feel like it.</p><p>Working out will only serve to your advantage and enhance your CoolSculpting® results by helping to maintain a steady weight. (David L. Kaufman, MD, Folsom Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Exercise after CoolSculpting</b></p><p>Absolutely you can exercise. We highly encourage our patients to resume or even begin to focus on healthy lifestyles. You do not have to make lifestyle modifications to appreciate the results of CoolSculpting, but investing in yourself with good daily hydration (at least 64 oz a day), adequate sleep each night (6-8 hours), healthy food choices and even mild to moderate exercise will enhance the results you attain with CoolSculpting and provide you with overall wellness.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_936" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-cc88f30cd85a6ec7e8555c2e66622829">

</div><p>In addition, exercise and hydration will help stimulate the lymphatic system, which is the transportation mechanism for processing and eliminating the fat cells that have been treated. (Darin Jackson, MD, Omaha Emergency Medicine Physician)</p><p>There is no restrictions in what you can and cannot do after Coolsculpting treatment. This does include exercising. In fact, exercise will only help enhance the results! (Hardik Soni, MD (not currently practicing), Summit Emergency Medicine Physician)</p><p><strong>âCoolSculpting requires no downtime or recovery</strong></p><p>It is a treatment that many active people, quite like yourself, do to help them freeze the stubborn areas of fat away. Being active after your treatments is encouraged to ensure the best long term results. (Michael E. Ciaravino, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Can You Exercise After CoolSculpting? Little to No Downtime With CoolSculpting</em></p><p>Many of my patients go straight to the gym after CoolSculpting. However, quite a number of others feel bloated or swollen for several days after treatment. You will know what’s best for you based on how you look and feel after you receive CoolSculpting.</p><p>If you are worried that exercise might interfere with your results, the opposite is true. Exercising after CoolSculpting (when your body is ready) will help you keep your newly sculpted shape over the long term.</p><p>Please consult a board-certified dermatologist to be sure you are a candidate for CoolSculpting. (Karen Beasley, MD, Baltimore Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>Can I Exercise After CoolSculpting? – Exercise Helps Your CoolSculpting Results</h5><p>You can absolutely exercise after receiving CoolSculpting! Because it is a noninvasive, well-tolerated fat-removal technique, CoolSculpting has little to no postprocedural downtime. Many of my patients exercise the same day they are treated. However, pay attention to what your body tells you.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_938" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>If you are feeling swollen or sore, then take a rest for a day or two until you feel better. Regular exercise will be one of the ways you will maintain the sculpted body that CoolSculpting gives you, so feel free to add it back into your routine as soon as you feel ready.</p><p>Please consult a board-certified dermatologist if you have any other questions about CoolSculpting. (William Groff, DO, San Diego Dermatologist)</p><p><b>Exercise after CoolSculpting</b></p><p>Yes, you can work out and return to all normal activities after CoolSculpting. There is no downtime with this treatment. It does not affect your results negatively. (Jeffrey M. Hartog, DMD, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Absolutely! Working out after treatment!</h4><p>There is no harm in working out after treatments. You can do anything you are comfortable with, people experience different levels of discomfort. Staying active and in normal routine will only help make results better!

</div><p><strong>Exercise post CoolSculpting</strong></p><p>The wonderful thing about CoolSculpting is that there is no downtime and you can resume your normal activities asap. You may have some tenderness in the area treated but the overall CoolSculpting treatment will not cause you to have to rest or limit yourself to any specific activities.</p><p>Exercise will help you to achieve those results very nicely. However, if you feel uncomfortable in the treatment area or feel as if you need a day to just relax, trust your body and do so. (Randolph Capone, MD, FACS, Baltimore Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There is no downtime after Coolsculpting so yes it is okay to exercise after treatment.

</div><p><strong>Exercising after CoolSculpting </strong></p><p>Yes, you can! The CoolSculpting procedure is completely non-surgical, so typically you can return to normal activities immediately after having the treatment. Many of our patients often head to a work out class on the same day after a CoolSculpting procedure is completed.</p><p>You may experience temporary bruising, swelling or tenderness in the treated area but nothing that should prevent you from exercising. (Anil Rajani, MD, Portland Physician)</p><p>You may want to wait about 5 days in case you have any discomfort. Working out will not negatively effect your final result. (Peter Hyans, MD, Summit Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The beauty of Coolsculpting is that there are no restrictions on activity after completion. Going to the gym is fine after the treatment. You might be a bit numb or sore in the area but there is nothing that will negatively impact your results. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I let my patients go to the gym without any issues. There are no major restrictions. (Jason Emer, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>One of the best aspects of CoolSculpting is that there is little to no downtime at all. The procedure is non-invasive, non-surgical and has no post treatment restrictions regarding exercise or other activities. So, feel free to workout and be as active as you want.</p><p>Many of our clients comment on how happy they were to be able to go straight from the Coolsculpting treatment room to the gym. Have a great time, and enjoy your results!.

There is no activity restriction after CoolSculpting. . (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Exercise after CoolSculpting</b></p><p>We usually tell our CoolSculpting patients to refrain from exercising immediately following treatment (same day), but to go ahead and resume normal exercise & activity after that. You will of course want to double check with your CoolSculpting provider. (Edward P. Miranda, MD, FACS, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You can return to all normal activity after having Coolsculpting performed including working out.
