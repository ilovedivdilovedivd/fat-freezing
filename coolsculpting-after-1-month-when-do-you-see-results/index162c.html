<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h3>1 month post op coolsculpting</h3><p>With coolsculpting, you may start to see changes as quickly as four weeks after your treatment. However, you will experience the full results of the treatment at about two months.  As long as you maintain a healthy lifestyle, long term results should be seen.</p><p>  I would definitely suggest a follow up appointment with the treating physician at your four month mark to compare your before and after photos with your physician.(Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p><b>Results 1 month out</b></p><p>Most patients tend to see results anywhere from 4 weeks to the full 90 days in treated areas. </p><p>Each patient responds differently and of course a healthy diet and exercise routine will only help benefit results as well.<br>
Also, keep in mind that some patients need more than 1 treatment to see optimal results. These can be treated as early as 30 days after the first initial treatment. I would revisit with your provider after 30 days to discuss options of re-treatment or wait the full 90 days prior to making any next steps. (Randolph Capone, MD, FACS, Baltimore Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>1 month after Coolsculpting, still waiting for results</h3><p>It can take 6-8 weeks to see results with Coolsculpting. I would wait it out. If still not seeing anything, make another appointment with your doctor and compare pictures. Using the Cooladvantage handpiece with Zimmer Z Wave makes the treatment more effective and more comfortable. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>1 month Post-Op</b></p><p>Although you may see results in as little as three weeks, some patients do not notice a visible change for about 6 weeks or more. It’s hard to see a change when you are looking at yourself everyday.<br>
Follow up with your specialist at the six week mark for your after photos. You will definitely see your results that way! (Steven Costalas, DO, Bryn Mawr Physician)</p><p><i>Coolsculpt results</i></p><p>It can take upto three months to see the results from coolsculpting. The very earliest signs of improvement will be seen after 1 month but it really just getting started at that point. My recommendation would be that you go back to the office after 2-3 months and have your after photos taken.</p><p>They will also weigh you at that point to make sure that you are the same weight as prior. Sometimes people gain a few pounds and that can detract from the results.  (Quenby Erickson, DO, FAAD, FACMS, Chicago Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting Results</strong></p><p>Most CoolSculpting patients see results between 1 to 3 months.  Some patients don’t see much until closer to that 3 month point.  Be patient and wait until 3 months post- treatment to follow up with your provider.  Most practices do before and after photos to best see the results from the treatment. (Jeffrey M. Hartog, DMD, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)<br>
<strong>Cool Sculpting not working</strong></p><p>For the high definition fat contouring that you are seeking, I would recommend a SINGLE session of high definition liposculpture instead of multiple sessions of a modality that is not as precise as traditional liposuction using specialized cannulas. (Arian Mowlavi, MD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Problems after Coolsculpting</strong></p><p>Coolsculpting can only treat subcutaneous fat, so if you can’t pinch fat under the skin, the treatment won’t do much. If you can pinch fat, a Coolsculpting treatment will reduce the amount of fat in that area.</p><p>Patients usually see results after 2-3 months, so be patient, you will most likely see a nice improvement over the next 1-2 months. Most of our patients get two treatments to each area to really maximize the result. (Andrew Campbell, MD, Milwaukee Facial Plastic Surgeon)<br>

Kane, MD, FACS, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon - 42 Year Old Female, 60 Days Following 1 Session Of Cool Sculpting" width="600" height="400" class="size-medium wp-image-1218 amp-wp-unknown-size amp-wp-unknown-width amp-wp-unknown-height amp-wp-enforced-sizes" layout="fixed"></amp-img><i>Coolsculpting results </i></p><p>While Coolsculpting results can be seen in as little as 3 weeks, in some cases, it could take 3-4 months to see the full results. I would give it some more time before you determine whether or not the treatment worked for you.</p><p>It’s also important to note that some patients do need additional treatments after the initial procedure. If this is a concern for you I would recommend speaking with the doctor who performed the procedure. (Jeffrey Rockmore, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>since coolsculpting only can reduce about 25% of the fat that is pulled into the appliance the results are subtle. If you were a good candidate photographs should show some reduction taken 3 months after the procedure. (William H. Jervis, MD, FACS, Walnut Creek Plastic Surgeon)<br>
Well first of all it has only been 1 month and the results really take the full 3 months to be fully appreciated. However, if you are a small person with minimal areas, then perhaps you should be considering SculpSure instead.</p><p>Look for a plastic surgeon who has both. (R. Brannon Claytor, MD, FACS, Bryn Mawr Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Coolsculpting results…..wait a little longer.</b></p><p>For 1 month it is not unusual to see only small changes, the most improvement is seen at 2-3 months. </p><p>Don’t forget many of the great before and after photos that you see are from 2 or even 3 session, so it is normal to require a second session. (Kally Papantoniou, MD, FAAD, Great Neck Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>1 Month Post CoolSculpting</h5><p>1 month is too soon to see results. It’s typical to start seeing results around 2-3 months. It’s a very slow process but the first sign is that you will feel better in your clothes. (Robert G. Aycock, MD, FACS, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)<br>

<strong>Coolsculpting results</strong><p>You are right at the point that you should start to notice a result. I tell my patients not to expect any results until at least 1 month post procedure and that their best results will be seen 3 months post procedure.(Renee Burke, MD, Barrington Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting Results</strong></p><p>Some may start to notice results as early as 3-4 weeks post treatment but it can take 12-16 weeks to see optimal results from treatment. It is still early. (Daniel J. Ritacca, MD, Chicago Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting Results</strong></p><p>Some patients begin to see results around four weeks after treatment, however, most do not begin to see results until 6-8 weeks with optimal results being reached at 3 months. Give yourself a little more time. (Landon Pryor, MD, FACS, Rockford Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>
<i>Coolsculpting results 1 month after treatment. </i><p>You definitely won’t see optimal results in the first month. It usually takes 2-3 months for your body to resorb the fat cells that were disrupted during the procedure. I would wait at least another month before you decide if the procedure met your expectations.</p><p>People who are close to normal weight are usually great candidates as the treated areas are usually more noticeable. (Matthew M. Dunham, MD, Colorado Springs OB-GYN)</p><h4>Waiting for Results</h4><p>I often tell my patients that waiting for your CoolSculpting results can be the most “painful” part of the process. It takes your body a good 2 months to naturally process and remove the fat cells and can take up to 4 months.</p><p>The process happens slowly so it’s difficult to “see” it happening, and for that reason the before and after photos are crucial. So be patient and make sure you follow up for your after photos. (Corrine Nelson, MD, Midlothian Pediatrician)</p><p><em>CoolSculpt and results</em></p><p>CoolSculpt is a nice way to decrease fatty tissue cells in areas of concern.  The results can vary from patient to patient.  Most patients see results within 4-6 months so you are in the early stages of the process.</p><p> If the applicator stayed on for the 1 hour, then you have had the proper treatment and you just need to wait for the time period stated.  However, not all patients get a result from the treatment.</p><p> We are not sure why not but it is the untold story about CoolSculpt.  Your doctor will discuss this with you.  If this should be the case with you, then you need to discuss options with your doctor.</p><p> Liposuction of course is a way to approach you but sometimes a repeat treatment of CoolSculpt is effective where the initial treatment might not have given you the results you desired.
