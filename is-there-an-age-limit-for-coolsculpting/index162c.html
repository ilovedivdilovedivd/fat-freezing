<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>There is no age limit with Coolsculpting. Coolsculpting offers fat reduction on areas with pinchable unwanted fat providing on average at least 20% reduction. Depending on your goals and candidacy it may be a great treatment for you since it’s non invasive with no downtime.</p><p>To determine if you are a candidate I would recommend a consultation. (Daniel J. Ritacca, MD, Chicago Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Coolsculpting and Age</h5><p>Patients of any age can be treated with Coolsculpt – it works for everyone with a pinchable area of fat – and you can expect to see a 30% reduction in fat with each treatment. The age of a person does not affect the results.</p><p>Make an appointment with a provider who has experience with Coolsculpting to develop an effective treatment plan. (Lisa Airan, MD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4107" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-cc88f30cd85a6ec7e8555c2e66622829">

</div><p>There is no age limit for Coolsculpting. The question is whether you are a good candidate for the procedure, in good medical health, and what areas you will want treated. Because this is a non-surgical procedure it is best suited for older patients since there is no anesthesia involved. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p><strong>Is 65 too old for CoolSculpting?</strong></p><p>There is technically no age limit for someone to have a CoolSculpting treatment. People in their 60’s are commonly treated. An examination is needed, however, to determine if someone (of any age) is a good candidate for the procedure. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>65 is not too old for CoolSculpting. You should find a provider and schedule a consultation. You will have a better idea of what the technology can do and if you’re a candidate. Our office have treated treatments of all different ages even over 65 with no problems. (Robert G. Aycock, MD, FACS, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Never to old for CoolSculpting</h4><p>As long as you are in good health and are not suffering from any of the contraindications designated by CoolSculpting and you are a good candidate for the treatment than you are the perfect age! I suggest making an appointment with a CoolSculpting expert in your area for a consultation where they can determine if you are eligible for treatment.</p><p>Remember, age is nothing but a number. (Peter J. Capizzi, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting for neck</i></p><p>55 is not too old to have a CoolSculpting treatment to the neck (turkey waddle). However, the procedure will only destroy some of the fat and not tighten the skin. An exam would be needed to determine if you might be a good candidate for the procedure or not. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon )</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4109" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>CoolSculpting results on abdomen on women in their 60’s versus women in their 30’s or 40’s</h3><p>In my opinion, the results from CoolScupting are not age dependent. Each patient needs to be individually assessed to determine if they might be a good candidate for the procedure. So, I would say that the amount of fat reduction from the procedure could potentially work just as well on a 60 year old woman as it could on a woman in their 30’s or 40’s. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting works well on fat at any age as long as you are a good candidate. Ensure that you see a physician with expertise in CoolSculpting, . (Martin Jugenburg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsclupting is a great procedure and you will have results in the abdomen. However, I would diet and exercise so that you can get to your ideal weight. Vanquish in combination with Coolsculpting will also help considerably. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p>Coolsculpting has been proven to be effective. You would get best results if you had Coolsculpting in combination with radiofrequency treatments such as Thermage, Vanquish, Venus Legacy with Z wave/Cellutone in order to maximize results.</p><p>you can get a hi def vaser lipo procedure and get even better contouring and shape. (Jason Emer, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting Can Remove Fat From Arms</strong></p><p>CoolSculpting is a very effective and noninvasive way to eliminate fat from your arms permanently. Cryolipolysis lowers the temperature of fat enough to send the fat cells into apoptosis (cell death). The body then eliminates the destroyed cells over the next few months.</p><p>Your final results will be visible after about four to six months. If your skin is lax, you may also need treatment with Ultherapy to tighten it. Please consult a board-certified dermatologist to find out if you are a candidate for CoolSculpting. (Melda A. Isaac, MD, Washington DC Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting is now FDA approved to treat upper arm fat, and it is has been very effective in the right candidates. If the fat is localized and the skin laxity is not great, then CoolSculpting is a good option for fat reduction.</p><p>Many women over the age of 50 have more skin laxity which may result in even more loose skin after treatment. Skin tightening procedures and firming lotions can help, but a personal consultation to discuss the condition of the skin would be needed to determine whether or not someone can benefit from CoolSculpting of the upper arms. (Mark E. Mason, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>How many sessions can one have</h4><p>As long as you have pinch-able fat to the area being treated you can treat the area as many times as you would like. These treatments need to be schedule at least 4 weeks apart. (Brian K. Reedy, MD, Reading Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4112" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Usually you need to wait 2-3 months before your next treatment. You can have multiple treatments but your doctor need to examine you to make sure is fat you are trying to treat and is not only skin. (Ramtin Massoudi, MD, Beverly Hills Physician)</p><p><i>Time Between Sessions</i></p><p>I recommend waiting for results, which are maximum at three months. If you have already had 3 sessions, you may want to consider a different area to see if that would give you the look you are trying to achieve. (Lillian Schapiro, MD, Atlanta OB-GYN)</p><p>Coolsculpting treatment plans are based upon the presence of focal fat deposits that fit within the different applicators-as such, an examination is central to knowing whether you are a candidate or not.</p><p>In some patients, we have seen some mild skin tightening as well. Be sure to find a provider who has gone through advanced training (aka Coolsculpting University), has the new Advantage applicators and has multiple machines so that your treatment will take less time.</p><p>Ask your PS about multiple procedure discounts if you proceed with your breast surgery and CS. (Vaishali B. Doolabh, MD, FACS, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Where is Coolsculpting performed?</strong></p><p>It is an easy non-invasive procedure that is performed in the doctor’s office. Our patients watch movies, work on their laptops or ipads, or even sleep during the treatments. It is not necessary to have it done in the hospital an incur hospital charges. (Grace Liu, MD, Newport Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Where are CoolSculpting Treatments Performed?</i></p><p>CoolSculpting is a non-surgical treatment and therefore is performed in a doctor’s office or clinic. Many patients watch T. V., read a book, work on their laptop or even take a nap!. (Miguel Delgado, MD, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Coolsulpting efficacy</h4><p>It is typical for physicians to be skeptical of new technology. Now that Coolsculpting has been around for several years, most of us have had the opportunity to use it, and see the results. For the right patient, Coolscupting is a great option for fat reduction with no down time.</p><p>With each treatment, about 20% of the fat in the treated area dies and is removed by your body over the next 3-4 months. You will still have fat in the area, just less of it.</p><p>If you gain weight in the future, you will gain weight there as well as your fat cells enlarge. It is safe, effective, and well tolerated. (Kelly Killeen, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Why Do Doctors Like Coosculting?</em></p><p>As you probably know, CoolSculpting is the first procedure cleared by the FDAfor the permanent removal of fat. Although I can’t answer for other doctors, I know that time and experience have proven to me that CoolSculpting is much more than marketing, it is highly effective and presents amazing results.</p><p>We have treated over 10,000 clients with CoolSculpting, and it has been very rewarding helping these patients change their lives.</p><p>The fat cells die over a three day period post treatment with CoolSculpting. These cells are then slowly removed from the body via the lymphatic drainage system. This process takes anywhere from 3-6 months to reach best results. This is a very natural and safe process. If you were to gain weight after having CoolSculpting, you will gain more evenly throughout your body than previously.</p><p>But, the great news is that you won’t gain as much in the treated areas. Good luck with your CoolSculpting journey. You will be joining thousands of others who have experienced this amazing treatment. (Edward Stokes, MD, West Hollywood Physician)</p></div>
