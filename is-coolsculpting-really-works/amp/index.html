<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><em>CoolSculpting freezes fat effectively</em></p><p>We were one of the first offices to offer CoolSculpting in Orange County, 4 years ago.</p><p>We have found it works great, for the right patient. Patients that are too thin with just loose skin, or those that are too “round” do not do as well as patients who just have bulges.</p><p>Doctors who don’t offer a procedure will usually say something doesn’t work because they want to do surgery instead or have you try something else.</p><p>CoolSculpting is the most effective non-surgical procedure available for fat reduction.</p><p>In my office we find it especially useful for our many patients who do not want lipo-suction. If you research who is doing CoolSculpting, most of the top cosmetic physicians offer it. We find it so successful we just bought a second machine to do “dual sculpting” (2 areas at the same time). (Lorrie Klein, MD, Laguna Niguel Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting really works.</strong></p><p>The ideal candidate for coolsculpting is someone who maintains a steady weight and exercises regularly. It does not reduce as much fat as liposuction, however it is noninvasive and very safe with no downtime. 20% reduction in the area treated is the expected result, some patients need to repeat the treatment to get further reduction. (Heather Haley, MD, Mobile Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>CoolScuplting Really Works</b></p><p>CoolSculpting is an excellent technique for the person that has a small amount of fat to lose. If you can pinch more than 2″ it would be better to lose weight first or have liposuction done.</p><p>Be sure to see a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon that offers both CoolSculpting and liposuction to determine which may be best for you. Ask to speak to a patient that has had the treatment done. (Miguel Delgado, MD, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting (freezing fat) really does work. It is ideal for treating people who are not overweight but have small areas of unwanted fat at the front or sides of the stomach. Liposuction (surgical fat removal) also works very well, but it is an invasive procedure with recovery time, whereas CoolSculpting is not.</p><p>You might consider consulting with a doctor who does both CoolSculpting and liposuction so that you can get the pros and cons of both. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Coolsculpting works, see the reviews on Realself.</em></p><p>Coolsculpting wouldn’t still be around after 8 years if it didn’t work. It has over an 82% rating on Realself. Its cost is based on how many cycles you need. It ranges in price from about 600-800 per cycle.</p><p>I would say a minimum of 4 cycles for your needs. I use the new Cooladvantage handpieces so treatment time is less, pain is less and perhaps results are better. The Zimmer Z Wave makes for 60-100% better results and I add this to all my treatments complimentary.</p><p>Adding Vanquish gives even better results. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>among non surgical options coolsculpting and sculpsure provide almost same results. one heats the tissue and one cools the tissue. they decrease fat by 20-25% each time used. normally people use them twice within few months.</p><p>it is worth in my opinion. surgical options are of course out there but most people want to try non surgical. (Parham Gharagozlou, MD, FACP, Walnut Creek Physician)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3492" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-c7b3e0b9854ed013c1592278f6f706f4">

</div><h4>Abdominal contouring procedures</h4><p>We are so lucky to be able to offer our patients so many different options for contouring the abdomen, surgical and non surgical. CoolSculpting and now SculpSure are new outpatient procedures that remove approximately 25% of the targeted fat with no down time and no surgery.</p><p>Liposuction will remove around 75% of the fat, and a tummy tuck around 90% of the fat, but these last 2 choices involve surgery, with anesthesia, scars and down time. Every patient is unique and the choice of which procedure should be made after a detailed consultation and evaluation by your physician.</p><p>I would suggest SculpSure instead of CoolSculpting. SculpSure is the worlds first FDA indicated laser for non surgical fat reduction of the abdomen and flanks. It is less painful than CoolSculpting, takes less time for a treatment (25 minutes vs an hour) and has less post treatment tingling, pain and discomfort.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3493" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>The laser targets just the fat cells and is more exact than the freezing process, with 4 applicator heads that can be positioned better than the one CoolSculpting applicator. I have both machines and prefer the laser over the cold therapy. Fees should be similar. (David Finkle, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Considering Cool Sculpting</h4><p>Coolsculpting is an excellent treatment for appropriate candidates. It is the best nonsurgical fat reduction treatment. However, it does have limitations especially for patients with loose skin or with a BMI over 30. Consult in person with an experienced and expert board certified plastic surgeon who directs a Certified Coolsculpting Center (not all centers that have Coolsculpting are certified) who has the ability to utilize a variety of surgical and nonsurgical options to understand your best options. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Please remember that with each cycle of CoolSculpting there will only be roughly 25% reduction of the fat deposits in the treated area thus some areas may require two treatments to achieve your desired goals. As the number of cycles goes up and second or third treating of specific areas cost should be given consideration as a comparison to liposuction which can be far more aggressive and remove much more fat at a single session than CoolSculpting.</p><p>Obviously down time, a surgical procedure vs. non-surgical, discomfort etc. all have to be figured into the equation hence a face to face open and honest discussion with a professional skilled at both liposuction and CoolSculpting will help you to find the best solution for you. (Paul Pietro, MD, Greenville Physician)</p><p>Remember that while Coolsculpting is an excellent choice for noninvasive fat removal it is far less aggressive than liposuction. Expect as you budget that you will likely want to do some areas a second time for the best result. The new Cool Advantage hand pieces are even more effective in about half the time. (Stacey Folk, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>An in person examination of the areas will determine if enough fat is present and if the tissue draws easily.</p><p>There are templates for the different applicators that are used to size the areas and determine which applicators to use. A CS specialist certified through CS University (advanced training from manufacturer) will do this automatically during the consultation.</p><p>Be sure you look for offices that have multiple machines and the new, faster applicators to cut down on your treatment times given the number of areas you want treated. (Vaishali B. Doolabh, MD, FACS, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
