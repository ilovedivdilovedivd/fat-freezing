<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>CoolSculpting is an outstanding treatment for those looking to reduce stubborn fat (resistant to both diet and exercise) in the abdomen, lower abdomen and flank region. CoolSculpting will permanently kill 20% to 25% of the fat cells permanently in the specific area treated.</p><p>This procedure works best when you are at or near your ideal and stable body weight. Post treatment you should not have any ‘lumpiness’ but may experience some of the more common adverse effects such as; redness, swelling, mild bruising, tingling or numbness.</p><p>All of these symptoms typically will resolve after a couple of weeks or more depending on the patient. I recommend contacting your physician or CoolSculpting specialist for a private consultation to go over these questions and address your personal goals to outline a successful treatment plan that is right for you. (Anil Rajani, MD, Portland Physician)<br>
CoolSculpting has been around for several years now. Its effects last — but it is a two-way street. You must use diet and exercise to maintain the effects; otherwise there is always a risk for weight gain and new fat formation if you decide not to take care of yourself. (Michael Gold, MD, Nashville Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting offers permanent fat cell reduction. When done properly by a trained physician, I would say the chances of developing lumpiness is low – but possible.</p><p>I would make sure you feel confident in your provider’s ability to assess and develop a customized plan for you.</p><p>We were the first plastic surgery practice in greater Houston to adopt Coolsculpting and I see patients before they have their treatment to ensure their suitability. (Young R. Cho, MD, PhD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)<br>
It has not been shown that there are long term effects of having this procedure performed. </p><p>Generally speaking, this procedure works best on patients who are as close to their ideal weight (or within 10 pounds) with areas of diet and exercise adipose tissue.</p><p>The treated area would generally decrease by 20-25%. Generally, the results are smooth. Our patients are liking their results with the CoolSculpting. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Coolsculpting works by freezing fat</h4><p>Coolsculpting works by freezing fat but since fat freezes at a higher temperature, the overlying skin is not injured. Plus it does this in a controlled manner to limit any adverse effects. The device also naturally feathers the area so there shouldn’t be any lumps of applied correctly.<br>

</div>Smaller individuals may notice more improvement since the treatment is meant for fat contouring, not for larger fat reduction. (William Kwan, MD, FAAD, San Francisco Dermatologist)
<h3>Coolsculpting effects</h3><p>Coolsculpting works on fat preferentially because those cells are more sensitive to cold. The device controls the process and temperature carefully giving a uniform result. </p><p>I have not seen contour irregularities (lumpiness) in any of my patients to date. (Burton M. Sundin, MD, Richmond Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Cool sculpting is not dangerous</b></p><p>Cool sculpting is not a dangerous procedure and the technology has now been around for several years with the manufacture taking into account feedback from both patients and doctors. The technology is not damaging to the body in anyway and does not have any significant adverse effects both in the short term as well as the long term. (Sameer Bashey, MD, Beverly Hills Dermatologic Surgeon)<br>
<em>Lasting results for unwanted stubborn fat</em></p><p>Zeltiq (CoolSculpting) provides a non-invasive approach to decreasing that unwanted stubborn fat that we just can’t get rid of. It does not provide the same results as liposuction but it also is not invasive and has no downtime. (Ava Shamban, MD, Santa Monica Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Adverse effects of cool sculpting</em></p><p>There are no documented long term problems with cool sculpting that Zeltiq has disclosed to my knowledge. The treatments take down visible bulges so remember to go to a reputable location that assures you are a candidate to begin with or you can “Chase the bulge” is what I believe you may be referring to.</p><p>Truly CS works best on clients with a BMI under 30, healthy height and weight with problem areas, not great for large volume reductions. (Robert Heck, MD, FACS, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)<br>
The best part about CoolSculpting is that in just a few hours, it offers a permanent solution to your fat reduction without the downtime or discomfort of surgery. As long as patients maintain their weight through healthy diet and exercise, the results will be seen long-term. (Louis P. Bucky, MD, Philadelphia Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Why does cool sculpting work</b></p><p>Fat is more sensitive to cooling than other tissues. Fat turns solid (freezes) at a lower temperature than the water that is in the other cells. It is possible for the result to be lumpy.</p><p>That is why you should look for someone with experience and good results. (Daryl K. Hoffman, MD, San Jose Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>How CoolSculpting works.</h4><p>CoolSculpting is the fastest growing and most pervasive FDA approved treatment for the noninvasive reduction of subcutaneous fat. In order to understand how the patented cryolipolysis process works to destroy fat without damaging skin, muscles, nerves, etc… we must first understand that fat freezes at a warmer temperature than water. The majority of our bodies are made of water as we learned as children in science class this includes the structures mentioned above with the exception of fat which is lipid based.<br>

</div>Imagine what happens when you put a container of chicken soup in the refrigerator. The fat separates and freezes at the surface. 
<p>CoolSculpting is taking advantage of this same principle by taking the tissue into and applicator and then bringing down the temperature to one that freezes fat but not water.</p><p>I have actually had the treatment myself and have been quite impressed with the results on my flanks as well as lower and upper abdomen. To speak to your question about lumpiness, it is imperative that you seek treatment from a provider that has attended CoolSculpting University as the results can be somewhat provider specific as applicator selection and placement can impact the results.

</div>The reason that only the fat freezes and not the surrounding tissues can be explained by a common finding in your kitchen. 
<p>If you have ever left a steak out on your counter after a BBQ you may notice that the fat in the juice of the steak becomes a whitish solid at room temperature or also the fact that butter is solid at room temperature, but water is liquid.</p><p>What this means is that fat freezes at a slightly higher temperature than water. The skin and surrounding tissue in your body is mainly water and will not freeze when cooled by the coolsculpt applicator, but the fat will.</p><p>So there is a critical temperature at which the fat will freeze, but the surrounding tissue will not. Coolsculpting hits that sweet spot. </p><p>The results from coolsculpting are generally very uniform because the applicator affects the fat in a block and there is a slight overlap of the applicators when performing coolsculpting in the appropriate fashion.</p><p>This is an advantage of coolsculpting over liposuction, which can often times produce “lumpy” results. There are virtually no long term adverse effects from coolsculpting when performed by an expert practice, except permanent fat reduction. (Paul Flashner, MD, Boston Physician)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting is an ideal procedure for individuals with small amounts of excess fat on the love handles or belly</i></p><p>CoolSculpting is an ideal procedure for individuals with small amounts of excess fat on the love handles or the belly. It is not a great treatment for women or men who are significantly overweight and who have very large love handles or a big full belly.</p><p>Individuals who are relatively trim who have localized area of fat achieve the best results. We almost never see rippling or a line of demarcation between the treated and untreated areas. Long term significant adverse effects are rare.</p><p>It sounds like you’re an ideal candidate and should do beautifully with one application on each love handle and 2 to 4 applications on your belly. Of course without having examined you and “pinched” your fat it’s hard to know for sure but I suspect you will do beautifully with the treatment. (Jeffrey Dover, MD, Boston Dermatologic Surgeon)</p></div>
