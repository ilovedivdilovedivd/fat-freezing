<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><i>Are Multiple Sessions Required for CoolSculpting</i></p><p>Well that really depends upon several factors such as how much fat there is to treat in your desired area and what are your eventual goals. </p><p>Studies show that CoolSculpting will reduce the amount of fat in the treated area between 20-25% in a fairly reliable fashion.</p><p>Repeating the treatment in the same area several months down the road can produce cumulative effects if they are desired. </p><p>Only you will know what percentage of reduction of fat will satisfy you. (Ted Brezel, MD, Long Island Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>The truth about Zeltiq …. It depends on how close you are to your ideal body weight</h5><p>Zeltiq is scientifically proven to reduce fat by about 20-25% in the area that is treated. If you are within 10% of your ideal body weight you should be very satisfied with one Zeltiq treatment.<br>
If you are heavier that 15% of your ideal body weight you may desire a second Zeltiq treatment to the area.</p><p>I have been doing Zeliq for six months and most patients are happy with one treatment. In fact, my patients are so satisfied with the results they typically ask for a different site to be treated at the next visit.</p><p>I had Zeltiq myself in November for a stubborn pouch of fat above my C-section area. The results are incredible and I am looking forward to treating another area soon. (Mohiba Khan Tareen, MD, Minneapolis Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Having a CoolSculpting by Zeltiq Procedure More Than Once</i></p><p>CoolSculpting produces an estimated 25% reduction of fat over a period of 3 to 4 months. If the procedure is repeated, than approximately an additional 25% of fat of the remaining area will be reduced. Patients need to understand that Zeltiq is not a substitute for liposuction techniques which will more accurately remove larger contour deformities.<br>
Zeltiq most effectively works for patients who have modest bulges in their lower abdomens and love handle or muffin top area but good overall core contour. Extending the technique to large deposits of fat will yield some reduction, but it may not satisfy the patient’s expectations.</p><p>Patients need to be honest with themselves about their goals before choosing Zeltiq or liposuction. (Carlin Vickery, MD (retired), New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Coolsculpting More Than Once?</b></p><p>The best answer to this question is how much fat is there in the area you want to treat. The ultrasound studies have proven a 22% reduction of fat with one treatment. In patients, the reduction varies between 20-25%.</p><p>If you are a relatively tone person with just small love handles, one treatment will probably be enough. Treatments are additive so if you are a heavier person with a larger area of fat, you will probably see more of a dramatic result with two or more sessions. (Grace Liu, MD, Newport Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>How many cool sculpting sessions do you need?</h3><p>Typically you will respond on average with a 20% -25% reduction in your fat layer in the treated area with one treatment. Subsequent sessions to the same area may result in further reduction in the fat bulge but are not necessary if 20-25% reduction is your goal. (Steven Hacker, MD, West Palm Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>CoolSculpting can be done every two months for a few treatments</b></p><p>Although one accepted protocol for CoolSculpting is to repeat the treatment at two month intervals, many patients are happy with one month, while others repeat at four or more months, depending on their results. To some extent, the amount of fat reduction needed initially can determine the number of treatments.</p><p>A thin person might only need one treatment, but someone with a larger amount of fat may need a few treatments because only about 20% of fat is reduced per session and it can take four months to develop the full response. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>You can do Zeltiq more than once and each time you do it you will reduce the area more</h4><p>Zeltiq is reducing on-surgical procedure for reducing fat bulges.  Typically I reccomend patients ddoing one area and waiting one month. They can then repeat that same area to get even better treatment results.  The first treatment will provide you with 20 to 25 percent reduction in a given area.</p><p>The second treatment can achieve an additional 20 to 25 percent reduction in that area.  If it appears form your consultation that the best results will be achieved with two separate sessions, we try to arrange it within a month so that you will have the best results in the shortest amount of time. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h5>Coolsculpting treatments may needed more than once</h5><p>Coolsculpting treatments may need to be repeated, but only if your figure requires it. Even after one treatment, very nice results can be seen! (Jeffrey E. Schreiber, MD, FACS, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Wait and See</h3><p>Results become apparent in 6-12 weeks following treatment. After proper wait time, a repeat procedure can be considered. (Cameron Rokhsar, MD, FAAD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Single treatment shows real results</i></p><p>the impressive thing about coolsculpting is that a single treatment yields real results. ultrasonic studies of treated areas show a reduction of 20% or more in a single treatment. furthermore, the treatment can be safely repeated if desired. (Eric Chang, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Cool Sculpting Procedure Details?</strong></p><p>Cool sculpting is an effective procedure using “freezing” technology that permanently removes fat cells. Patients can expect about a 20% reduction after a procedure that lasts approximately one hour. The procedure can be repeated on the same area in a few months. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>
<strong>Number of Sessions</strong><p>The number of treatment sessions depends on your body build and your desired result. The majority of patients undergo just one treatment. (David Finkle, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting – how many treatments needed?</em></p><p>This completely varies among individuals. With each treatment you typically see a 20% reduction in the treated area. If the area of excess fat is small, only one treatment may be needed. If it is more significant, multiple treatments may optimize the results.</p><p>I have my patients wait at least 60-90 days between successive treatments. (Lori Stetler, MD, Dallas Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Once is often enough for Zeltiq</h3><p>Although most of the results that you see on the before and after galleries is just one treatment it is not a problem to increase results by repeating treatment. Each person will respond a bit differently.<br>
The expectation is that one treatment will reduce the fat layer in the area by about 20%. Some will be thrilled with this, some will want more. As they say “results may vary”. (Susan Van Dyke, MD, Paradise Valley Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>Many patients are happy with one zeltiq (coolsculpting) treatment</h5><p>Our center was one of the ten inital study sites for the device The overwhelming majority of our patients have been happy with one treatment There is approximately 20-25% reduction in thickness of the fat layer that is treated Patients with larger amounts of fat may need more treatments, depending on their goals.</p><p>We have had no complications with this treatment and there is no downtime! (William Groff, DO, San Diego Dermatologist)</p><h4>Zeltiq More then Once</h4><p>Coolsculpting by Zeltiq generally recommends 2-3 treatments for optimal results. You should see a reduction in fat after one treatment, however, a 2nd or 3rd treatment would have an additive effect. I always recommend 2 or 3 treatments for the best results. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
