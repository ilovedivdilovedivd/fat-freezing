The suction and the temperature are controlled by the machine (not the administrator of the machine). (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Some patients can experience mild discomfort during the first 5-10 minutes of the treatment – a feeling of an odd pulling sensation that will fade into a numb sensation during the course of the treatment. Few patients can experience some bruising and a little numbness in the treated area which subsides over 2-3 weeks. (Steven Gabel, MD, FACS, Portland Hair Restoration Surgeon)</p><h5>Benefits of freezing fat cells by Zeltiq</h5><p>Zeltiq is generally well tolerated by most patients. Patients do experience discomfort for the first few minutes until the cooling numbs the skin.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_614" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The remainder of the treatment is well tolerated. The abdomen tends to be slightly more sensitive than the love handle area.</p><p>Zeltiq does cause some nerve sensation in the post-op period that will be most symptomatic at a week to two weeks.</p><p>Resolution then occurs over ensuing weeks. The choice of suction size is made depending on the area to be treated, thus most abdomens are treated with the large suction appliance in order to get a smooth result.</p><p>The device has been FDA approved in the United States since 2010. (Carlin Vickery, MD (retired), New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Zeltiq Coolsculpting: minor discomfort</strong></p><p>There is usually a mild transient pain upon starting the procedure especially when suction begins. This is short lived and most patients are relaxed and don’t feel any pain the remaining portion of treatment time Any bruising is temporary and in our experience last no more than 18-24 hours, most times there is none at all.</p><p>We have had a few patients feel some numbness for up to several weeks. Our patients are generally very happy with this no-downtown treatment. (Joshua L. Fox, MD, Long Island Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Zeltiq treatment Expectations</h4><p>This is really are very controllable treatment in terms of post treatment course. Although it feels cold and strange, it does not hurt. There is ussaully no bruising . You can feel numb for about 4 weeks in the area. (Barry E. DiBernardo, MD, Montclair Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Zeltiq is an exciting new method for reducing fat deposits wihtout surgery</strong></p><p>Zeltiq is an exciting new method for reducing fat deposits wihtout surgery. There is minimal pain and reports of side effects have been minimal (mostly bruising and temporary numbness). (William P.

</div><p><i>Pain, bruising…</i></p><p>Coolsculpting with the larger applicator has a higher incidence if bruising and discomfort than the smaller applicator. In patients who are unlikely to tolerate the increased discomfort, we will opt to use the smaller applicator 2 times across the lower abdomen, which covers the same area without overlapping.</p><p>We have found that this causes less discomfort. (R. Brannon Claytor, MD, FACS, Bryn Mawr Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Zeltiq CoolSculpting – Pain, Bruising, Risks?</h5><p>CoolSculpting is a completely non-invasive procedure with no downtime – you can maintain and resume regular daily activities per normal both before and immediately after your treatment. Even during your treatment you are completely alert and made to feel comfortable by watching TV, answering emails, and eating and drinking per normal.</p><p>After the treatment is finished, some patients may slightly bruise or feel lingering numbness at the site, but this does subside in a few days and shouldn’t hamper any normal routines. (Louis P. Bucky, MD, Philadelphia Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_617" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><b>Freezing fat cells risks of pain, swelling and bruising: Alternatives</b></p><p>As with any cosmetic procedure, freezing fat cells is not without risks. The most commonly reported risks are pain, swelling and bruising. There are some more rare reports in the literature of patients actually having more fat after having the procedure done.</p><p>Fortunately, it is generally a safe procedure and once the pain and swelling subside, patients are generally pleased. A new alternative to Coolsculpting has been FDA approved for non surgical body contouring called Sculpsure. It uses laser energy to cause fat cells to die and tissue to shrink.</p><p>The real advantages of this procedure is that it only takes 25 minutes per area (Coolsculpting takes about an hour) and more importantly, there is no pain, swelling or bruising. The FDA study showed a similar amount of fat reduction as Coolsculpting.</p><p>There is no post treatment care for Sculpsure and you can even go right to the gym after a treatment. Talk to surgeons who use Coolsculpting and ones who use Sculpsure, and find which is the best to accomplish your goals. (Travis L. Shaw, MD, Richmond Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>CoolSculpting discomfort</h5><p>We began using CoolSculpting in 2011 and have performed 4000 procedures. The early treatment heads depended upon strong suction to draw the fatty areas into the device. I’m a wimp and I thought it was uncomfortable for about 10 minutes.</p><p>Over the last six years Zeltiq has improved the treating devices and they use far less suction making them much less uncomfortable. Suction pressure is now controlled by the machine. Treatment times have decreased, being only 35 minutes in some areas.</p><p>Some sites are more uncomfortable than others (ie male breasts, chin,arms). There is no required post treatment care. (Maurice M. Vick, Jr., MD, Baton Rouge Urologist)</p><p><em>Zeltiq is safe and effective</em></p><p>Zeltiq was recently approved by the FDA for fat reduction of the abdominal region. The device is effective for this purpose in carefully chosen patients: close to ideal body weight, good skin elasticity and a focal region of fatty tissue. (Scott C. Sattler, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Zeltiq Coolsculpting has no serious side effects</h4><p>The procedure known as Coolsculpting is the process of localized removal of fat bulges in the abdomen and lvoe handles via cryolipolysis. The procedure is very safe. The side effects have all been studied extensively and now over 35,000 patients have been treated.</p><p>Their are minimal side effects such as temporary mild bruising , discomfort or numbness. The procedure is safe and noninvasive. (Steven Hacker, MD, West Palm Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Cool sculpting risks</h4><p>Having had coolsculting done on several areas on myself I can tell you that the most discomfort you feel is with the initial vacuum as your area to be treated is suctioned in. It feels like a tight squeeze for about 1-5minutes.</p><p>Once the chilling gets going, you actually don’t feel much. Increasing the vacuum is only needed to get a better grip on the area treated. The more vacuum pressure, the more chance of minor bruising.</p><p>After the procedure you may feel temporary numbness, tingling, and sensitivity to touch for about 1-2 weeks and is easily relieved by motrin or sleeve. No studies have shown any permanent nerve damage. (Grace Liu, MD, Newport Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Coolsculpting by Zeltiq is well tolerated</em></p><p>Most patients feel some pulling and discomfort only for the first 10 minutes while the applicator is placed. Once the area is cooled, it is a painless procedure that takes one hour. Some patients may feel some temporary numbness at the site for approximately one week after Zeltiq.</p><p>It has been in Europe and is approved for all areas in the body in Europe. Proper suction is required into the applicator to free the area and achieve the correct results. That is why it is important to go to a well qualified physician for the procedure. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h4>CoolSculpting by Zeltiq is comfortable – tips and thoughts</h4><p>Most patients say that there really wasn’t much hurting after, my skin felt a bit numb, there was some sensitivity, and maybe there was some bruising, but that all went away.</p><p>But there are some patients who have had discomfort afterward, almost a nerve pain like-feeling, that has resolved in all patients.</p><p>But there is a fuller answer possible here. For instance, throughout the history of liposuction, all patients were given form-fitting compression garments after their procedure to avoid swelling, bruising, and discomfort, and achieve “best results”.</p><p>So the big question with CoolSculpting® is why not use a compression garment, just like after liposuction? It has worked so well for all of these years, so CoolSculpting patients should wear them for a few days, maybe a week, (not the weeks needed after lasers and liposuction).</p><p>What have we found? Wow, what a big difference for comfort after CoolSculpting®, with a few days use of a compression garment. (Douglas J. Key, MD, Portland Dermatologic Surgeon)</p></div>
