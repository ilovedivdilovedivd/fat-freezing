<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><strong>Zeltiq for the thighs</strong></p><p>The inner and outer thighs are difficult areas to treat. We have had some great results but patients need to be selected carefully. </p><p>Not everyone is a good candidate. Just because we can get the suction to attach to the skin does not mean we can draw up enough fat into the chamber to give an effective result.</p><p>The fat needs to be able to be grabbed and quite pliable to fit into the chamber. If it’s firm, it will not draw up, though it will attach. </p><p>A face to face consult with someone who has done a lot of procedures is best. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Zeltiq for thighs</strong><br>
As has been asked and answered before. Zeltiq can be used effectively on any area of the body. We are restricted only by the hand pieces supplied by the parent company. </p><p>If you can place the hand piece properly on the thighs then it will work.</p><p>The company is in the process of developing new heads for the thighs, arms and neck. (David Finkle, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Coolsculpting for the thighs</em></p><p>Currently the hand piece for Coolsculpting is designed for the abdomen and love handles. There is a thigh handpiece that is in development. </p><p>Regardless, treatment results vary by individual and proper patient selection is paramount.</p><p>Some thigh fat will respond other types may not. Your physician should be able to give you realistic assessment prior to treatment. Either way it is an off label treatment. (Steven Hacker, MD, West Palm Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Zeltiq Coolsculpting reduces unwanted fat that can be pulled into the device’s applicator</i></p><p>Zeltiq Coolsculpting allows for the reduction of unwanted fat. I regularly perform the treatment on my patients’ lower and upper abdomens, love handles, flanks, bra fat, and inner thighs. It works by freezing the fat cells and triggering a process for fat reduction over a period of weeks to months.</p><p>To be effective, the targeted fat must be pulled between the device’s 2 cooling plates during treatment. Although many ask for the outer thighs to be treated, this area often does not have enough pullable or pinchable fat to reach the cooling plates.</p><p>Like all of the targeted areas with Coolsculping, the outer thigh must be assessed on a case by case basis for its candidacy. </p><p>Whatever areas are ultimately treated, I recommend having your physician apply the applicator to the targeted fat to ensure an effective and optimal treatment. (Robert T. Anolik, MD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)<br>
Zeltiq CoolSculpting can be used to reduce the fat of the outer thighs. However, the ‘bulge’ of fat should be able to fit and be suctioned adequately into the cooling applicator. A patient with very fibrous, ‘hard’ fatty tissue in this area may not be a good candidate because the fat cannot be ‘molded’ into the applicator. It is best to have your CoolSculpting specialist evaluate you to determine if you are a good candidate for fat reduction on the thighs. (Leyda Elizabeth Bowes, MD, Miami Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>The Zeltiq company is developing a treatment head designed for flatter surfaces such as the thighs- I have no experience using it, but its coming to market at some point. (Scott C. Sattler, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon) </p><h5>Coolsculpting for Inner Thighs?</h5><p>We have counseled and treated a large amount of patients for inner thigh fat. The key to a great result is a good assessment of whether or not the area to be treated can fit the applicator.</p><p>If all sides of the applicator do not touch skin, you cannot create suction to draw the fat in and do a treatment. Last week, Zeltiq the manufacturer just released a new applicator called the CoolCurve which works for smaller areas.</p><p>As always, we counsel patients that thighs are an off label indication. This area is pretty comfortable area to treat discomfort wise and responds well. As one of my patient’s husband said ” I saw the fat melting away from my wife’s thighs!”  (Grace Liu, MD, Newport Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)<br>
CoolSculpting is FDA-cleared for the flanks (love handles) and abdomen and is proven to be a safe and effective treatment. I would speak with a board-certified doctor to determine whether CoolSculpting could be effective on your inner thighs. (Daniel Shapiro, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting on Inner Thighs</i></p><p>We have actually treated a couple of patients on their inner thighs, it’s very tricky because the applicators aren’t shaped to fit that area. I would recommend finding a physician that has actually treated that area. (Ben Hugo, MD, Virginia Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>We’ve treated many women on their inner thighs with great results. The limiting factor is if the tissue is of adequate volume/size and lax enough or pliable enough to fit into the applicator. If the tissue fits in the applicator adequately then you should see a reduction in fat in that area.</p><p>The best way to determine if you are a good candidate is to have a consultation with a practice that does Coolsculpting. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I have treated a number of patients in this area. The answer to the question is that it depends. There has to be enough laxity of the skin that the fat can be pulled up inside the CoolSculpting applicator.</p><p>In addition, Zeltiq, the manufacturer of the CoolSculpting device, just released a new applicator, called the CoolCurve +, The advantage is that it has a more curved contour which should allow up to treat more patients with bulges in areas such as the inner thigh.</p><p>I suggest you see a Certified CoolSculpting practice in your area for an evaluation. (Ted Brezel, MD, Long Island Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Tumescent liposuction is very effective for inner thighs.</b></p><p>As you can see, different opinions. We have not seen great results with CoolSculpting and we don’t want disappointed patients. (George J. Beraka, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Coolsculpting for the Inner and Outer Thighs</h4><p>Coolsculpting is a fabulous procedure and there is a special adaptor for both the inner and outer thighs.  We have had great results with these adaptors and also for the back of the buttock area.</p><p>We are certified by coolsculpting an have all of the latest adaptors to make your treatment easy and successful. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p>Zeltiq has come out with a new applicator called the CoolFit that can address fat reduction on areas such as the outer and back of thighs. It is contoured to fit these areas better than the previous applicators that didn’t fit these areas.</p><p>It’s always a good idea to obtain a consultation to see if you are a good candidate for this treatment. (Steven H. Williams, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>CoolSculpting on outer and inner thighs for fat reduction</h5><p>Certainly, CoolSculpting by Zeltiq, has been FDA cleared for the abdomen and the flanks and doctors are able to utilize it, off-label, on the outer thighs. Now with the recently acquired CoolFit applicator, which is flat compared with the curved CoolPlus, 6.2, 6.3 and 8 applicators, we are looking forward to seeing results on the inner thighs using the CoolFit off-label. There may be side effects or risks that will be more apparent after a time during which many doctors treat many patients with the device for the thigh areas so stay well informed and ask your doctor many questions. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting is a great solution for non-invasive fat reduction of the thighs in the right patient. There is a special applicator that is designed for the outer thighs. Treatment of the inner thighs can be tricky if not performed by an office with extensive experience in treating thighs.</p><p>If the wrong applicator is chosen, there can be potential for a “step-off” or indention. Most patients will need multiple treatments for best results. (Kyle Coleman, MD, New Orleans Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Can CoolSculpting be done on the thighs?</h4><p>CoolSculpting can be performed on the thighs. The most common areas that are treated on the thighs are the inner and outer portions. Not everyone needs both areas treated however. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting can be done very successfully on the inner or outer thighs. On the outer thigh, the Coolsmooth Pro applicator is often used as this tissue can not usually be drawn up into the standrd applicators.</p><p>On the medial thigh the applicator selection will be more dependent on you anatomy. (Gordon Lewis, MD, Midlothian Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
