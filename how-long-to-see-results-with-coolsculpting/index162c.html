<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h3>Coolsculpting Results and Time of Procedure — Add Vanquish/Cellutone For Improvement</h3><p>With each Coolsculpting you should theoretically get 15-20% improvement so for “contouring” and fat reduction you’ll need a few treatments overlapped in the surrounding areas.</p><p>The results will be apparent in 3-4 months. Your diet and exercise must remain consistent so fat will not go into the other areas or back in the same area.</p><p>Add RF treatments like Vanquish to get more of an outcome — we call this “fire and ice” combination in our practice. (Jason Emer, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>One procedure lasts about and hour per area. One area is about the size of your hand. Some patients find getting a second treatment beneficial. The best results are shown between four and six months. (Hardik Soni, MD (not currently practicing), Summit Emergency Medicine Physician)</p><p><em>Treatments are much quicker with new CoolAdvantage Applicators and DualSculpting Centres</em></p><p>These new applicators can now treat areas in 35 minutes instead of 60 mins so reducing time by almost 50%.</p><p>The contour produced is smoother and also 45% more comfortable. And if you choose a practice that has DualSculpting, then it may be possible to treat two areas simultaneously, further reducing time to treat in half! (Ravi Jain, MBBS, London Physician)</p><p><em>1 Hour for Long-Term Fat Reduction</em></p><p>The CoolSculpting treatment itself lasts for about 1 hour, after which there’s no downtime or recuperation necessary. While some patients are satisfied with their results after a single treatment, others are better served by a series of 2 or 3 treatments.</p><p>It really depends on the amount of fat you’d like to treat. You can maintain your results indefinitely by keeping a steady weight and adhering to a healthy lifestyle. (Mark E. Freeman, MD, Idaho Falls Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>CoolSculpting for Fat Loss</h5><p>CoolSculpting takes approximately 1 hour per area. In order to provide elimination of fat as quickly as possible we do offer CoolSculpting Complete. This includes two systems, for twice the fat elimination in a one hour period.</p><p>Find the top provider of CoolSculpting in your area. Some high volume practices can offer instant rebates of one area at no charge Results can be seen after a single session, but some patients see an improvement but might desire an additional treatment for optimal results.</p><p>Vibrational therapy increases circulation and lymphatic drainage which my help waste, including damaged fat cells be eliminated with the body more efficiently. Finally, al of our patients receive a compression garment to help with skin quality and comfort. (Michael Law, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting procedure</strong></p><p>Each cycle of the machine takes one hour, and depending on what is being treated, you may have 2 – 4 cycles on the same day. The procedure usually results in a fat reduction of anywhere between 20-25% per treatment, so therefore, at 2-3 month intervals you may need another treatment. (Michael Gold, MD, Nashville Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>CoolSculpting vs. Vanquish</h5><p>Each cycle of CoolSculpting lasts one hour. The number of treatments is dependent on the desired result. If one wants to treat both love handles two cycles are required, i.e. one cycle for each love handle.</p><p>If one wants to treat both love handles and central abdomen three cycles and three hours are required. After completion of one cycle you can expect up tp 15-20% of fat reduction within three months.</p><p>With two cycles per love handle up to 30% fat reduction can be acheived. CoolSculpting is for localized fat reduction in specific areas. If one desires treatment of the entire abdomen (both love handles and central abdomen) at the same time one should consider Vanquish treatments.</p><p>Vanquish uses radiofrequency to melt the fat instead of freezing it. In one thirty minute session the central abdomen and love handles are treated; however, a series of sessions is required (typically one thirty minute session per week for four weeks). (Melda A. Isaac, MD, Washington DC Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolscupting results can last for a very long time</strong></p><p>As long as you follow a healthy diet and exercise, you can maintain your results for a very long time. Depending upon your current shape and size, 1-3 treatments may be necessary. However, many people see a nice result after only one treatment! (Jeffrey E. Schreiber, MD, FACS, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_262" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><b>CoolSculpting Typically Lasts 1 Hour & Usually Two-Three Treatments Are Needed Depending on the Patient</b></p><p>A typical CoolSculpting session is one hour. The procedure is performed by first selecting the appropriate head based on the anatomic location being treated. Suction is then applied and the skin and fat fold is brought into the suction head.</p><p>It is then compressed between two plates giving it a feeling of being pinched. After the skin and fat layer is secured between the two plates, the temperature is dropped sufficiently to freeze the fat.</p><p>The device is left in place, treating the patient for one hour. Multiple areas can be treated at the same session, each receiving a one-hour treatment. Most patients report a significant pinching feeling for the first five to ten minutes.</p><p>Following this, as the tissues are cooled, they discomfort subsides. Afterward, patients report variable degrees and lengths of time of discomfort. Some people notice a mild discomfort for a few days and others report more significant discomfort for up to two weeks.</p><p>Usually, bruising afterward is minimal, if any. Common areas treated are the abdomen, the flanks or love handles, and the upper back fat along the bra line. If there is sufficient tissue to be treated in the arm area, it can be used for excess fat in the underarm area.</p><p>Usually, it is not utilized in the lateral thigh fat because is it not possible to pinch this fat and subsequently treat it. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>CS time and treatment cycles vary</h3><p>Technology has advanced and now applicator cycles are only 35 minutes! You can save additional time if you find a CS provider that has more than one machine so that multiple areas can be treated at the same time.</p><p>Of course, the larger applicators can also treat more areaduring the cycle, so be sure to consult with different CS providers to see what they offer. (Vaishali B. Doolabh, MD, FACS, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>We offer three different sizes for parts of the body. Each treatment can be for 45 mins to one hour.</p><p>There is a possible need to re treat an area of your body after a few months sometimes.</p><p>Plan on one to two hours for the front of the abdomen area with the COOLSCULPT. (Sanjay Lalla, MD, FACS, West Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>How long does it last?</h5><p>With the new cool advantage applicators treatments are now more comfortable and last about 35 min per area. How many treatments you need depends on the amount of desired reduction and the amount of fat you currently have.</p><p>With each treatment about 20-25% of fat is reduced in the area. It is best to be evaluated in person to get a better idea of your particular needs. (Michelle Ellern, DO, Livingston Physician)</p><p><strong>Dual Sculpt for CoolSculpting</strong></p><p>Each cycle is roughly 60 minutes, so 60 minutes pre spot. Depending on how many CoolSculpting machines the practice has, and if they are able to “DualSculpt” , completing 2 cycles at one time. Each PT is different, and will require a indivial treatment plan.</p><p>Consultation is recommended. (Keith Durante, MD, FACS, New York General Surgeon)</p><p>Treatments will have maximal effect by 3 months. Whether or not you need additional treatments will depend on you clinical exam. Once the fat is removed, it is gone for life. (R. Brannon Claytor, MD, FACS, Bryn Mawr Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>A cycle last for an hour</h4><p>We have two Cool Sculpting machines in our office because we felt that the best way to perform bilateral treatments on the love handles, hips, or thighs was two have two machines working at the same time.</p><p>We also offer the Cool Smooth to treat the lateral thighs. (Robert Whitfield, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting treatment Procedure </strong></p><p>CoolSculpting is a non-invasive non surgical fat reduction procedure that uses advanced precise cooling technology to gently and effectively target and eliminate fat in specific areas of the body involves No needles, No Cutting, No Downtime, NO garments, No need for anesthesia or pain medications and there is no recovery time.</p><p>The procedure last about 1 hour per area. Most of our patients require just one treatment. However, some need additional treatment depending on their fat reduction goal. (Stanley Okoro, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
