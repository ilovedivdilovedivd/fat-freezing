<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>I know it can exciting to already jump into your second session of Coolsculpting, here are a few important things to consider before you retreat:</p><p>If you started with a thicker layer of fat in the desired treatment area, your second treatment should be about 3-4 weeks post initial treatment.</p><p>If you have less fat in the treatment area, we would recommend waiting up to 3 months time to let your results from the Coolsculpting fully develop.</p><p>This way you can determine whether you even need that second session. (Edward Stokes, MD, West Hollywood Physician)</p><p>We do not recommend less then 2 treatments of CoolMini for submental fullness. The secondary treatment is performed 6 weeks after the initial treatment. It can take 3-4 months to see optimal results from Coolsculpting. (Kathleen Morno, MD, Highland Park Physician)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5302" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>CoolMini Results</h3><p>Everyone that does CoolSculpting for the double chin using the CoolMini applicator will need 2-3 treatments to see optimal results. The results after the first treatment can often be minimal and subtle, but further improvement occurs after the 2nd treatment.</p><p>It’s important not to become discouraged after the first treatment. We typically space treatments 6 weeks apart, but even after 5 months it’s not too late to do another treatment. Remember, though, that CoolSculpting is a treatment for fat and it will not have much of an effect on the loose skin under the chin.</p><p>For best results you may want to combine your CoolMini treatment with a skin tightening treatment. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><h5>Second CoolMini?</h5><p>Most patients require two or three treatments to see really significant reductions in fat with CoolMini. (Sheryl D. Clark, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5303" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><i>Retreating with CoolSculpting</i></p><p>When treating the segmental “double chin” most patients require 2-3 treatments to see best results in fat reduction. At our practice we do require a pt to wait approx. 4-6 week before retreating. Keep in mind, when treating with CoolSculpting you are reducing the FAT in that area, CoolSculpting does not tighten the skin. However, it is never too late to retreat with CoolSculpting. (Keith Durante, MD, FACS, New York General Surgeon)</p><h4>Coolmini for submental fat</h4><p>The process of fat loss takes up to 3 months to fully appreciate. Most of the changes should happen in the first 6 weeks though. As you know, the Coolmini is a new addition to the Coolsculpting and is used to treat the upper neck and submental area.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5304" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>It might require more than one treatment to get to the desired result. I add Zimmer Z wave to all treatments to enhance results as well. Some will add RF to further improve results. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Getting The Best CoolMini Results</h4><p>Most people will need between 2-3 CoolMini treatments under the chin for optimal results. We space these out every 6 weeks.</p><p>Combining the treatments with ThermiTight or Ultherapy can help further improve results. Make sure you are seeing an experienced provider. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolmini Results improve with Kybella, Ultherapy, Thermage versus Vaser Hi Def, ThermiRF</strong></p><p>It can take up to 3 months to have your final results with a Coolmini and it can take multiple treatments. Combining a Coolmini with treatments like Kybella, ultherapy, thermage, exilis will improve results. However, I find that VASER HI DEF with ThermiRF gives the best results in contouring the chin in those who are candidates.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5305" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I recommend seeing an expert in facial contouring for a formal evaluation. (Jason Emer, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Best time interval between CoolSculpting treatments?</b></p><p>The “standard” recommendation for a second (or third) treatment in the same area is 4 weeks however I have found waiting closer to 8 weeks seems to give improved results. If the plan from the beginning was to perform two treatment then any time after four weeks would be fine.</p><p>If however you wanted to see your results and then decide if a second treatment is “needed/desired” then I would wait the full 3 months before making that decision. (Paul Pietro, MD, Greenville Physician)</p><h4>30-90 days</h4><p>There are several factors that can go into your decision. The chin area can be treated as soon as 30 days after your procedure. However the first treatment can have results up to 3 months after. So if you have a smaller area of concern, you may want to wait the 3 months to see the full result.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5306" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>However if you have a larger area of concern it may be a good idea to get your second treatment after the first month, so that you can reach your ultimate goal quicker. It is best to consult with the physician that is treating you, so that you can get the most accurate answer. (Janet Allenby, DO, Delray Beach Dermatologist)</p><p><i>How long until second treatment</i></p><p>If it was decided per your physician at consultation that you will need two in the area, then you can treat as soon as 30 days. If not and you decided to treat one to see results first, then I would recommend waiting the full 90 days prior to re-treating.</p><p>At 90 days, I would have a follow up appointment with your physician to see if a second one would enhance your results. (Randolph Capone, MD, FACS, Baltimore Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5307" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><strong>CoolMini Response Time for Under The Chin Treatment</strong></p><p>Protocol is typically 1 month, but we’ve generally seen a better response if you wait for a 2nd month. If you are in a hurry, you can certainly have another CoolMini treatment after one month, but that 2nd month may provide you with a better visual profile and greater evidence of the procedure’s effectiveness.</p><p>The ultimate response is unchanged regardless of the frequency of treatments – the end result is based on the number of treatments performed. (Stanley Kovak, MD, Oak Brook Physician)</p><p><em>Time between Coolsculpting Treatments for Double Chin</em></p><p>We recommend patients not to repeat Coolsculpting of the Double Chin for a minimum of 6 weeks. Patients can benefit from a second treatment months even years from the original treatment. Ensure that the treatment is being performed by Certified Coolsculpting Practice under the direct supervision of the physician.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5308" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Not all centers that have Coolsculpting are certified and the physician will ensure the best placement and best execution of the treatment. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Consider 2 CoolMini treatments about 6-12 weeks apart</h3><p>If just using the coolMini under the chin I would consider between 2-4 cycles. I tend to do them laterally, overlapping the central portion. So thats two cycles in the first session. Then wait 8 weeks or so to see if a 3rd or 4th cycle is required. (Ravi Jain, MBBS, London Physician)</p><p><i>Coolmini for double chin</i></p><p>You would start seeing results after getting a treatment with the Coolmini as early as 3 weeks, but the results keep improving until 3 months. Most patient would require 2-3 treatments with the Coolmini to get optimal results, and we recommend waiting at least 6-8 weeks before getting the next treatment.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5309" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>If you are debating if you should get a second treatment, I would recommend waiting about 6-8 weeks to see if you are satisfied with the results and then if needed, plan for the next one. (Rosy Sandhu, MD, Winchester Internist)</p><p>All the marketing photos from Zeltiq are based on two treatments. We were taught in training to almost always quote patients for two. Secondly, they recently expanded the chin treatments to overlap and hit more of the lateral chin (overlapping) so choose a center who has sound and updated training. (Timothy Treece, MD, FACS, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>CS results evolve over 3 months</i></p><p>Generally speaking, the under chin area can be treated with an advanced protocol if there is excess fat extending towards the sides a little-when this is done, you should wait 3 months to see the effect of the overlapping applicators.</p><p>If you had just one applicator placed in the center for limited chin fat, you may see some results by 4 weeks but these will continue to evolve over the next 2 months. A certified CS specialist will guide you further on the interval of treatment, number of applicator cycles and placement–your before & after photos will be helpful in deciding. (Vaishali B. Doolabh, MD, FACS, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>After treatment with CoolSculpting, it can take up to 3 months for patients to see their results. The reason for this is that it takes this amount of time for the body to completely eliminate the crystallized fat cells from the body.</p><p>It can be beneficial for patients to have a second treatment after 1-2 months. Consult your CoolSculpting provider to determine the best timing for your next treatment. (Jerome H. Liu, MD, San Jose Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolMini for chin area</em></p><p>Usually 2 cycles of CoolMini are done during the first session with some overlapping of the applicators at the central portion of the double chin for optimal outcome. After a CS session, it will take on average between 8-12 weeks to see the results and to determine if more cycles are needed (Alain Michon, MD, Ottawa Physician)</p></div>
