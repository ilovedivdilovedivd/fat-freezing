<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Yes you can get CoolSculpting for the stomach. CoolSculpting is one of the most effective devices for noninvasive body contouring.</p><p>It is important to go in for a consultation with an experienced provider to see if you were a candidate.</p><p>Most clients will require anywhere from 1 to 3 sessions to get optimal results depending on the amount of fat that’s there.”</p><p>CoolSculpting is not meant to be a weight-loss device. It is meant for body contouring of localized areas of fat.</p><p>Most clients will either see or feel a difference after one treatment and I would say that in our practice 90% of her clients will see if visible improvement after two sessions.</p><p>Cool sculpting can also be performed on other areas such as flank, bra fat, arms, inner and outer thighs.</p><p>Most recently cool sculpting has also been used for the double chin. (Hardik Soni, MD, Summit Emergency Medicine Physician)</p><p>Cool Sculpting of the stomach is an approved area for treatment. Please make sure to go to a reputable location for your evaluation.</p><p>Having had other treatments listed above are not contraindications to cool sculpting. (Robert Heck, MD, FACS, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting of the stomach is very common. It is best to have an in-person consultation in order to determine the best plan for you.(Quenby Erickson, DO, FAAD, FACMS, Chicago Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Massage after CoolSculpting on stomach</h3><p>The recommendation from Zeltiq, the maker of CoolSculpting is for a two minute massage immediately at the end of each CoolSculpting cycle. This has been shown to dramatically increase the success of the procedure compared to when no massage is done.</p><p>The effect of a vibration table was not part of the initial trials where all current protocols have been developed and thus its true effect is unknown. Will it hurt your results? No. Could it help? Maybe.</p><p>Bottom line is any therapy that can help with the initial “breaking of the fat cells right after therapy will be helpful. Others can help with post treatment discomfort. (Paul Pietro, MD, Greenville Physician)</p><p>While we all know that CoolSculpting works, there is evidence out there that using a device called the Zimmer Z Wave improves the cosmetic results and makes the procedure work faster.</p><p>We utilize this device with all of our patients and this has been a nice addition for all. So find an office with a Zimmer Z Wave as it can truly make a difference. (Michael Gold, MD, Nashville Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3911" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h4>CoolSculpting Effects On Fat Cells</h4><p>CoolSculpting causes a natural cell death in the fat cells. It reduces the number of fat cells. Through diet and exercise you can reduce the size of your existing fat cells which can further improve your results. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><h3>Coolsculpting and Fat Cell Death</h3><p>Coolsculpting kills fat cells permanently. (Jason Emer, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting Kills Quantity</em></p><p>The CoolSculpting procedure selectively applies cooling to treatment areas to trick the body into using its own process to destroy fat cells in the treatment area. The cells get confused when they are exposed to such low temperatures and begin pre-programmed cell death called apoptosis.</p><p>The process generally takes two treatments per treatment site and best results are generally seen about 4 months after the first treatment. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3912" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>coolsculpting is a FDA approved, non-surgical treatment of stubborn fat in areas including the waist, under arms, chin, thighs and back. The process is controlled cooling/freezing of fat cells causing a reduction in the number of fat cells (20-25%) and destruction of the frozen fat cells.</p><p>The frozen at cells are natural removed by the body over several weeks. This is a great therapy for targeted fat reduction but not as a weight loss technique. (Omar J. Barakat, MD, Munster Radiologist)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting: Is it for Weight Loss?</i></p><p>CoolSculpting iS an amazing treatment that permanently removes 20-25% of the fat from the areas that are treated. The results are smooth and natural looking. However, CoolSculpting is not designed for weight loss. It is designed to be most effective on those who are within 10-20 pounds of their goal weight.</p><p>The majority of patients will need to treat a minimum of 2 times in order to achieve optimal results. For those who do not fit the ideal criteria as good candidates, CoolSculpting can help to reduce the various bulges that keep clothes from fitting well.</p><p>Keep in mind that results do take about three months to fully show. You can treat again after one month . If you treated now, and then again in one month, you would see full results of both treatments by the end of 4 months.</p><p>Additionally, you would want to schedule an in-person consultation to see if you are a candidate for CoolSculpting.</p><p>They would need to see and feel your fatty tissue to know if CoolSculpting is right for you with everything! (Edward Stokes, MD, West Hollywood Physician)</p><p><i>Is CoolSculpting able to help lose belly fat?</i></p><p>We see so many ads on TV and media for CoolSculpting and it sounds like everyone should do this. However, the reality is that while CoolSculpting is a great treatment to reduce localized fat deposits, it is not a weight loss treatment.</p><p>Best results are seen in patients who are within 10-30 lbs of their ideal body weight. Without seeing you and knowing your height, I would not be able to tell if you are a good candidate.</p><p>One thing to consider is that CoolSculpting results are not seen for 2 months after the treatment with final results 4 months after the treatment session.</p><p>I would suggest working with your family physician to further improve your lifestyle with diet and exercise.</p><p>For instance, low carb/high protein/low fat diets such as South Beach diet with properly caloric amounts as well as 5-6x weekly exercise including cardio and weight training will help you lose fat more quickly.</p><p>The other option would be to consider possible liposuction or LaserLipo for more rapid fat loss which would be more noticeable. (Mary Beth Mudd, MD, Columbus Physician)</p><p><em>How to know if a CoolSculpting Practice is Legitimate</em></p><p>Any CoolSculpting practice that is actually certified by the parent company Zeltiq, would be listed on their website. There are always those who purchase second hand equipment and have no certification. I would not trust them to make a permanent change in the shape of your body.</p><p>The training and certification process that actual certified practices undergo is quite intensive and important. I would not trust anyone who has not been thoroughly trained and certified by Zeltiq. (Edward Stokes, MD, West Hollywood Physician)</p><p><i>Coolsculpting providers</i></p><p>First of all, you don’t know those machines will give the same results or that they are as safe as Coolsculpting. All legitimate Coolsculpting providers will be listed on the Coolsculpting site. The practices may claim they offer Coolsculpting but ZELTIQ has the only trademarked and patented machine for cryolipolysis. (Jonathan D. Kramer, MD, Meridian Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Fake machines are out there</strong></p><p>There are definitely some Chinese knock-offs that are marketed. You should only go to a center listed on the company website as they have the only proven and tested machine on the market.</p><p>Side effects from the fake machines can be significant so do not take the chance with your body. (Houman Vosoghi, MD, Los Angeles Physician)</p><h3>CoolSculpting copy machines</h3><p>Please be aware that there are a lot of copy machines, made mainly in China, in the market. These machines have not undergone trials and so there is no data to show that they are safe or effective.</p><p>Here in the UK, there has been a huge problem with these copy machines. These machines, have in numerous people, caused third degree freeze burns, since the skin has also been frozen by these copy machines.</p><p>This has resulted in people having to have plastic surgery. Doctors who have the CoolSculpting machine are listed on the CoolSculpting website. You can also call the company for confirmation. Please do check out the clinic before proceeding and having a treatment. (Rekha Tailor, MBChB, Farnham Physician)</p><p><strong>No CoolSculpting results after 3-4 weeks</strong></p><p>It takes about three months to see the full effect from a CoolSculpting treatment, so it is not unusual that you might not see any change at 3-4 weeks after the procedure. Give it a bit more time and reassess your results in a couple more months. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Patients typically don’t start to see results until 4-6 weeks after Coolsculpting on stomach. It takes 3-4 months for your full results. At our practice we prepare patients to be patient because they do not see any noticeable changes right away.</p><p>We also encourage patients to come in for a 3 month follow up so we can take pictures and address any concerns. (Jeffrey B. Wise, MD, FACS, Wayne Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>With CoolSculpting on stomach ultimate results are not seen until the 90 day period from your initial treatment. Some patients may or may not see results as early as 30-45 days. Every person responds differently to this treatment.</p><p>I would wait the additional 60 days. Should you still not see a result I would recommend following up with your doctor to see if an additional treatment is needed as most patients need at least 2, sometimes 3 treatments to see desired results. (Randolph Capone, MD, FACS, Baltimore Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
