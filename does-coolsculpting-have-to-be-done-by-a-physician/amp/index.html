<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Each state has different laws in regards to who can perform particular medical procedures. You may want to check with the governmental agency that licenses physicians in your state to see who can perform CoolSculpting procedures where you live.</p><p>I do perform CoolSculpting procedures on my patients but other doctors may prefer to have a nurse or healthcare assistant perform the treatment. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Coolsculpting certification provides advanced training</h5><p>CoolSculpting does not have to be performed by a physician, but the specialist should have a thorough understanding of body contouring principles.</p><p>The manufacturer does provide advanced training (known as CoolSculpting University) and certifies the specialist to help assure good outcomes.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4171" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>If you have any problems with your treatment, a place that is overseen by a licensed doctor will be a benefit. (Vaishali B. Doolabh, MD, FACS, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Licensed Doctors/ Cool Sculpting</h3><p>In my practice our certified nurses are RN’s we trust, we have trained and have worked for us many years.</p><p>Because we have a group practice we always have a physician in the office in case a client needs a physician consultation (i.e. not a candidate for cool sculpting).</p><p>In short, we take cool sculpting seriously and although those spa like settings most likely have a medical director you are surely not going to get the same level of care in my opinion then if you would go to the physician office that has cool sculpting. (Robert Heck, MD, FACS, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4172" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Coolsculpting is frequently performed in med spas and it is true that some of them may not have a licensed physician overseeing the med spa. I would recommend you go to a coolsculpting facility where you will be evaluated and have a treatment plan devised by a board certified plastic surgeon.</p><p>The advantage of having a plastic surgeon is that they can best tell you whether you a candidate for coolsculpting or if there is a different option such as liposuction or surgery that may help you achieve your goals. (Arun Rao, MD, Tucson Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting is a non-invasive treatment option to reduce fat in targeted areas with the use of cooling device to freeze fat cells. The frozen fat cells eventually die and are naturally removed by your body.</p><p>Some key points to know about CoolSculpting include:</p><ol>
<li>Only one area can be targeted per treatment.</li>
<li>Treatment session take close to one hour.</li>
<li>Areas of treatment usually require 2-4 treatments</li>
<li>No anesthesia.</li>
<li>FDA-approved</li>
</ol><p>Schedule a consultation to see if you are a candidate. If so, enjoy the results. (Omar J. Barakat, MD, Munster Radiologist)</p><p><b>CoolSculpting Does Work</b></p><p>CoolSculpting reduces subcutaneous fat bulges by about 25%. It is best to see a board certified plastic surgeon to see if you are a candidate for CoolSculpting and to learn all of your options. CoolSculpting has not yet been FDA cleared for the arms and is considered off-label. Although many offices offer CoolSculpting for the arms, the doctors you may have talked to might not. An in-person consultation with a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon will give you the best answers for what you are looking for. (Jeffrey M. Hartog, DMD, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>If there is continued pinchable fat, you can be treated with Coolsculpting. You shouldn’t get rippling or lumps. Other treatments to consider are Vanquish, Exilis. Make sure Z Wave and Cooladvantage are used to maximize your results from Coolsculpting. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Coolsculpting and Second Treatment</h4><p>Coolsculpting is an amazing procedure for reducing abdominal, flank, and buttocks bulges. We have been performing Coolsculpting for years in our office. It reduces the fat by 20 to 25% in a given area. The company now recommends that you can have the second treatment in a given area one month after the first treatment. Please consult a board certified dermatologist with a great deal of experience with Coolsculpting for the best cosmetic results. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h3>Time Between CoolSculpting Treatments</h3><p>We typically wait between 2-3 months after the first CoolSculpting treatment before we do another treatment. In my opinion 1 month is too soon. You start seeing results after 1 month, and the process continues with further improvement up to 3 months.</p><p>There’s no point in trying to kill fat cells that are already dead. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><h4>Timing of second CoolSculpting treatment</h4><p>My preference is to wait about 2 months in between CoolSculpting treatments, although I have done them as soon as a month if that is the patient’s preference. There is absolutely no harm in waiting a longer time period though.</p><p>I would recommend waiting to see how you feel in another few weeks and then you can change the time of your second treatment if you feel you’re not ready. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4176" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>Second CoolSculpting treatments</h3><p>Typically you can start to see results in 1 month. By 3 months the results are complete in most cases of CoolSculpting except with CoolSmooth. You can wait and see how you recover. We have two machines so we can dual sculpt areas more efficiently. (Robert Whitfield, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Usually it is recommended to wait 3 or so months before the second CoolSculpting treatment.</h3><p>I doubt that there will be any harm for only 5 weeks betweens Zeltig CoolSculpting treatments. It is felt that it takes about 3 months or so for the treated fat cell to under go the natural death cycle of fat cell.</p><p>I don’t know of any study about earlier treatment but you will be able to give us the answer soon. (Carl W. “Rick” Lentz III, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Tummy tuck versus CoolSculpting</strong></p><p>CoolSculpting can be used on the front of the abdomen to reduce fat, but it will not tighten skin.</p><p>A tummy tuck primarily address the issue of excess skin, but fat removal can be done at the same time.</p><p>If you can’t afford the recovery time involved with surgery, I would consider trying the CoolSculpting first and seeing if you are satisfied with the results. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Visceral Fat and CoolSculpting</i></p><p>Coolsculpting can be very effective for the easy to target “pinchable” fat and your first treatment will often be more dramatic due to the fact that it’s your body’s first exposure to the treatment. Sometimes if you have a lot of fat tissue, you’ll be left with some “pinchable skin” which is what it appears like you have in some of the pictures.</p><p>I would recommend seeking the in-person opinion of a top provider of both weight loss and coolsculpting in your area and take it from there. You can see the top providers on the official coolsculpting website and they also list who is “certified”.<br>
(Douglas Halliday, PhD, MD, Syracuse Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Opinion of CoolSculpting</h3><p>In my opinion, CoolSculpting is a great non-invasive option for fat reduction to isolated areas of the body. It is not a weight loss treatment or a treatment for someone who is obese. Volume reduction can reach 20-25% with a single treatment session. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting or SculpSure works well for the lower abdomen</i></p><p>CoolSculpting (fat freezing) or SculpSure (laser fat melting) both would work well for a small localized area in the lower abdomen. SculpSure is the newer procedure, is less painful than CoolSculpting with no down time and the treatment takes only 24 minutes compared to an hour with CoolSculpting.</p><p>Both should remove on average 25% of the subcutaneous fat. It takes around 8-12 weeks to see the results of either procedure. (David Finkle, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Is CoolSculpting good option?</i></p><p>You really need to be examined to determine if you would be a good candidate or not. The procedure is ideal for people who are not overweight but have isolated areas of fat that do not go away with diet and exercise.</p><p>It is difficult to know how many treatments you might need. Some people only need one treatment session while others may need 2-3 to reach their desired results. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting, like many other devices that are non-invasive can yield very nice results with proper use/ application. It is by far the leading permanent fat reduction solution in the world right now with over 2 million treatments, but results can vary depending on the body area and how well the applicator is applied.</p><p>Choose a clinic that has a lot of experience and has a board certified physician on staff. We’ve had many successful CoolSculpting Plus treatments at LipoSpa for thighs, tummy and other areas such as flanks.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4173" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>From time to time, we’ve also found that in order to get the best results, our clients have undergone more than one round of CoolSculpting treatments. As for Ultrashape… the device has simply not been around long enough for us to feel comfortable adopting or recommending. (Douglas Halliday, PhD, MD, Syracuse Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Options for fat reduction</b></p><p>In general, liposuction can remove the most amount of fat in a single treatment session, but it is invasive and requires a recovery period.</p><p>If you are looking for the most noticeable results in one treatment and can deal with the recovery period, this may be the best option to treat the areas of unwanted fat in your hips, inner thighs and abdomen.</p><p>CoolSculpting and laser lipolysis (SculpSure) are both non-invasive fat reduction treatments that generally do not involve a recovery period. Both procedures normally will destroy about 20-25% of the fat cells in the treated area in a single treatment session.</p><p>Repeated treatments can result in further fat loss. If your main goal is to avoid recovery time, one of these options may be better for you. An examination of you would be necessary in order to determine if you might be a good candidate for any of these procedures. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
