<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h5>Coolsculpting Cost.</h5><p>The great thing is that Coolsculpting is non-surgical and non-invasive. As a result, there are no other fees involved like anesthesia, facility fees, etc. You just pay for the procedure one-time and that’s it.</p><p>Pricing for coolsculpting is based on the applicators used. The applicators are how the machine freezes the fat. There are different sizes and shapes of applicators.</p><p>From large to small, to flat to curved. Depending on the shape of the body area and the amount of fat to be treated, different applicators will be needed.</p><p>This is where a consultation with an experienced Coolsculpting technician will come in.</p><p>They can help you choose the right applicators to give you the best results and the best bang for the buck. Applicators can start at $700 each and run up to $1400.</p><p>You should be able to buy packages of multiple areas to save even more.</p><p>But compared to surgical fees, downtime and risk, Coolsculpting is truly a cost-effective method to deal with unwanted fat! (Lawrence Broder, MD, Cedar Park Family Physician)</p><p><b>Cost of Coolsculpting</b></p><p>In Lawndale, CA, the cost of Coolsculpting using the mini or regular applicator costs appox $750 for one cycle but can go as low as 500$ per cycle. We also have a larger applicator which costs $1500 per cycle its great for larger areas quickly treating in only 35 minutes. (Anoosheh Lolachi, MD, Torrance Physician)</p><p>The cost is dependant on each individual and their ultimate goals. We suggest that you set up a consultation. At that time we will assess your problem areas and draw up a customized treatment plan.</p><p>At that time we will discuss the cost. (Rachel Dunn-Black, MD, Yreka Physician)</p><p><strong>How much Does Coosculpting Cost?</strong></p><p>The cost of CoolSculpting depends on both the number of cycles needed and the number of areas being treated. Each person is unique and requires a treatment plan tailored specifically to meet their individual needs.</p><p>Although one cycle costs $750, a treatment to transformation requires multiple cycles over 2 treatment session (roughly 8 weeks apart). At our clinics we offer discount package pricing, loyalty rewards and 0 % financing over 12 months! (Marcia Fleming, MD, Vancouver Physician)</p><p><i>Cost of Coolsculpting</i></p><p>The cost will depend on the applicator used and how many treatments are needed. The smaller applicator can be $600-$750 while the larger one is $1500-1800. Most offices will give discounts if a patient gets multiple areas treated.</p><p>Each treatment can result is a 20-25% reduction of fat in that specific area. Some patients are happy after 1 treatment, others return for another treatment of the same area 8 weeks later. The great thing is that THERE IS NO DOWN TIME…. one hour/area and then you can go back to your normal activity! (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting specials in Houston</strong></p><p>Here are some ways to get a deal on coolsculpting: buy more than one area (eg, upper abdomen and lower abdomen), buy a treatment at the same time as a friend who also buys a treatment, or attend a promotional education session at your physician’s office. (Melissa Chiang, MD, FAAD, Houston Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting is a great non invasive way to reduce fat on the love handles, bra fat area, and abdomen</i></p><p>It can also be used for the arms, thighs, buttocks, and men’s chests. We have been performing CoolSculpting treatments since 2010. Cost depends on the amount of areas you need treated. Most patients prefer having each area treated twice for best results.</p><p>Individual treatments can be as low as $500 per area. Seek a Board Certified Dermatologist with extensive experience in CoolSculpting treatments for maximizing results. (Carolyn Jacob, MD, Chicago Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>Cost of CoolSculpting in Nebraska</h5><p>CoolSculpting is charged per applicator head size. The medium applicator is $750. The large applicator is $1,500 (2 1/2 times larger than the medium applicator). If you have three areas treated the cost drops to $700/area ($2,100 total) and four areas treated, the cost drops to $600/area ($2,400 total).</p><p>We are now recomending a second treatment 4 weeks after the inital treatment to get 40-50% of the fat removed. The second treatment is offered at a 50% discount off the original price. If you paid $1,500 for your first treatment than the second treatment will be $750.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_81" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>There is no extraneous charge, this is not an operation, there is no surgeon’s fee, facility fee, anesthesia fee and no down time.</p><p>You could get up from your CoolSculpting treatment and run a marathon if you desired! (David Finkle, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Coolsculpting Costs</h4><p>Coolsculpting currently has three applicators. The most used applicators are the medium and the large applicator. Each treatment cycle per applicator is one hour. The range of prices for the medium applicator range from $700-900 per treatment.</p><p>The range of prices for the large applicator which covers 21/2-3 times the area of the medium applicator are $1500-$1800 per treatment. Most offices offer discounts with package treatments since each treatment reduces the fat by 20-25%.</p><p>The best way to truly assess your cost is to have an evaluation to see if you are a good canidate and for the practitioner to use the applicator template to show you which applicator is best for the area you want to treat. (Grace Liu, MD, Newport Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Coolsculpting costs start at $750</em></p><p>Coolsculpting pricing starts at about $750 per region. Your doctor would need to examine you to best determine what and how many regions would be recommended for your specific needs. (Jon E. Mendelsohn, MD, Cincinnati Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting Costs</i></p><p>The cost for CoolSculpting will be quoted upon consultation. There are many variables when looking at cost including the exact areas to be treated and the appropriate equipment to treat these areas.</p><p>We offer a complimentary consultation to patients who are considering CoolSculpting In Columbus, Ohio.</p><p>In addition we have monthly seminars to discuss the benefits of CoolSCulpting. (Christine Sullivan, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>CoolSculpting Cost</b></p><p>There is a range of fees with CoolSculpting depending on which treatment (unit) you would need. A large applicator is counted as 2 cycles. The cost is approximately $750.00 per cycle, although when you receive more than 4 cycles the price will start to drop.</p><p>The CoolMini, which is primarily used for the submental area is 900.00 per cycle. (Eric P. Bachelor, MD, Pleasanton Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>CoolSculpting Pricing</h3><p>A single CoolSculpting session starts at $750. We have package pricing, the more sessions you purchase the larger discount you receive.</p><p>Depending on your goals and whether or not you want to achieve Treatment to Transformation depends on the number of sessions you will need to purchase.</p><p>We offer Alphaeon Credit which is 18 month no interest and Care Credit Financing which is 12 month no interest. (Mark Pinsky, MD, Palm Beach Gardens Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Here’s a range of how much Cool Sculpting by Zeltiq cost</h4><p>The cost for Cool Sculpting by Zeltiq is usually priced per bulge. When you come in for a consultation, the medical provider would count up how many fat bulges bother you and calculate it from there.</p><p>For example, usually, the price is somewhere between $750 to $975 per bulge. The lower abdomen is comprised of two bulges (the left lower and right lower abdomen). Two bulges multiplied by $750 is $1500, or 2 X 975 is 1950. In this example, for the lower abdomen, the price range for Cool Sculpting by Zeltiq costs $1500-$1950.</p><p>The price range for the love handles would be about the same being that there’s typically one bulge on the right love handle and one bulge on the left love handle. (Some call this a muffin top, or spare tire 🙂 Assuming that there’s only one bulge per side, because everyone’s different, we can assume the price range to be somewhere in the ballpark of $1500-$1950.</p><p>That’s where the consultation comes in-to determine how many fat bulges can be reduced by Cool Sculpting by Zeltiq. Beware that, sometimes what you think may be a fat bulge may actually be just skin laxity.</p><p>At times, I do consultations and find that the person’s bulge is not a Cool Sculpting candidate because it’s just excess skin and no fat. Please come in for a consultation because, usually practices like ours offer a discount for multiple areas or multiple treatment modalities to meet your goals cosmetically and financially.
