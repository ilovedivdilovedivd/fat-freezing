<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Reduce the volume and put on your favorite narrow dress is the dream of every woman. American scientists have come up with a procedure that promises to save beautiful ladies from excess fat.</p><p>Coolsculpting upper abdomen is a procedure in which selective and strictly controlled cooling of adipose tissue occurs, followed by destruction of fat cells.</p><p>With age, unnecessary fat deposits accumulate in different places even in slender women. And first of all they are noticeable on the abdomen.</p><p>A group of scientists from the Harvard Medical School came to the aid of those wishing to lose weight.</p><p>They proved that reducing the temperature of subcutaneous fatty tissue for 60 minutes leads to the natural death of fat cells – apoptosis.</p><p>Based on these studies, the device was created that is capable of cooling various parts of the body and destroying fat cells.</p><p>In order to avoid fakes and keep their invention, manufacturers hide what kind of temperature affects on the fat. Do not know this information even the doctors who conduct the procedure.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_7701" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Before going to the procedure, I studied the testimonials of those who had already experienced the procedure on themselves.</p><p>And the further I read, the more I was shivered. Women wrote: “When the device sucked the fat fold, it was so painful that my head was spinning, pressure was falling, noise in my ears …”</p><p>Immediately after the procedure, I felt strong tingling in the abdomen, by the evening the place was blistered. The clinic diagnosed frostbite. The belly was twice as large … “The most innocuous in this series of reviews is the lack of any result.</p><p>Is it worth talking about how scared I was. In the clinic, the doctor dispelled all my worries. For three years of her work with the apparatus such cases were not. In her opinion, people who left negative feedback fell into the hands of unskilled specialists who perform the procedure at low prices on non-certificated devices.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_7702" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The doctor examined the zone of “distress” on my stomach, evaluated the type of the body shape, the thickness of the skin-fat fold, measured the volumes.</p><p>In our body there is deep fat that is the one that protects cells and organs from cold, injuries and inflammations, we can not live without this fat. Rarely, but it happens that the fatty layer is too dense, the stomach is like a soccer ball. The device needs a soft and pulling fold for suction.</p><p>The device has two nozzles, which can remove excess fat from the inner and outer parts of the hips, from the knees, from the sides, from the back, hands and abdomen. Doctors take it reluctantly for the area of the buttocks, since there is a risk of creating asymmetry.</p><p>My stomach was covered with a gel napkin that protects the skin from hypothermia and ensures uniform lipolysis. Then the nozzle of the apparatus took 2-3 minutes to draw a fat fold on the abdomen. It does not hurt, you feel a slight chill. I was covered with a towel, gradually I got used to the device, I had exactly one hour to sleep.</p><p><strong>Indications</strong>: excess fat deposits on the chin, arms, back, waist and upper and lower abdomen, knees, hips.</p><p><strong>Contraindications</strong>:</p><p>pregnancy and lactation period, the presence of a pacemaker, skin diseases in the treatment zone, umbilical hernia, cold intolerance, diabetes mellitus, bronchial asthma, some kinds of moles.</p><p>The advantage of coolsculpting upper abdomen is that the procedure is not traumatic. For example, liposuction, including laser, involves skin punctures, which requires anesthesia and thorough disinfection.</p><p>The technology of coolsculpting excludes cold damage to the skin, nerves, vessels and internal organs. Only fat cells die.</p><p>They find themselves in the freezer and within an hour without oxygen and food begin to break down. It lasts for two months.</p><p>As a result, the number of fat cells should decrease by at least 20-30% per procedure. In my case, the doctor promised 90% success, that is, if I want to repeat the session, then the nozzle simply will not have anything to drawn on my stomach. </p><p>Depending on the thickness of the subcutaneous fat and patient’s wishes, it is possible to perform up to three procedures with a periodicity of two months. As soon as the nozzle was removed from me, I felt a slight tingling sensation. In two hours all the redness was gone. The doctor warned that on the third day, tingling can happen again, as well as pleasant itching and minor painful sensations when dressing. There can be no sagging of the skin, since the cold simultaneously acts on it as lifting.</p><p>For two weeks, I was banned from drinking alcohol. In order to avoid a temperature difference, do not visiting the sauna and lying in a hot tub two weeks. No special creams and ointments are needed on the body. There was no change on either the third or the seventh day, my stomach remained the same. Only after two weeks the stomach was slightly tightened. The measurements showed minus one centimeter. It turns out, the process has started.</p><p></p>

</div>After the procedure, I came to the conclusion that losing weight with the help of device is a method for lazy ones. Do not think that after making the procedure, you can continue to live idly. The result must be secured and maintained.
<p>The doctor gave me recommendations on proper nutrition, a recipe for ginger tea, a list of physical exercises to strengthen the muscles of the back and abdomen. With unconcealed irony, I will say that if you adhere to all these rules, you can lose weight without expensive coolsculpting. </p><p>However, such a procedure can be a good starting point and an incentive to start a healthy and active lifestyle, eat right, drink up to 2 liters of water a day, limit consumption of flour, sweet, fatty food. Then the result will not be long in coming.</p><h3>Reviews</h3><p></p>

</div>The procedure of coolsculpting of upper abdomen is comfortable, does not require special training and rehabilitation. 
<p>Reducing the volume of fat tissue occurs gently and gradually. Interestingly, unlike other methods of weight loss, the fat cell is not simply flattened, but completely destroyed. This ensures a lasting stable result. </p><p>The procedure is painless, excludes the side effects typical for surgical and injection techniques, for example, pain, swelling, bruises, scars, and the lack of medications will not cause allergic reactions other than cold allergy.</p><p>The effect is growing. Immediately after the session, fat loss is guaranteed up to 30-50% and a decrease in volumes of 4-5 cm – this is superior even to the results of liposuction. Success in many ways depends on the mood of women. There are positive patients who wait and receive the result, feel it, but there are those who always doubt the success and do not believe in it from the beginning.</p></div>
