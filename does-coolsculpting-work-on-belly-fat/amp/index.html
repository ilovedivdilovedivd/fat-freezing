<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>It depends on the person. CoolSculpting WORKS WELL for those with stubborn fat, despite proper diet and exercise. Isolated fat under the chin or arms, around the belly or back, is perfect for CoolSculpting, a targeted cooling that kills fat cells.</p><p>CoolSculpting does NOT work well for someone with too little or too much fat. Someone with so little fat as to not completely fill the CoolSculpt probe, will see limited benefit. CoolSculpting is not designed for someone with excessive fat all over his or her body.</p><p>Rather, medically supervised weight loss (nutrition and medications) would be more effective for someone who is very overweight. If this person has stubborn fat AFTER losing weight, he or she would be a great CoolSculpting candidate! At OmniAestheticMD we combine medical weight loss with fat reduction technology to produce optimal results. (Joseph A. Eviatar, MD, FACS, New York Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Coolsculpting works on belly fat</h3><p>We use coolsculpting in our office and have seen good success with it. I would say that it is important to go to a provider and get a good understanding of the mechanism of action.</p><p>Patient selection is also very important. Coolsculpting is a great treatment for the soft, subcutaneous belly fat. However, it cannot be used to treat deep, visceral fat. Also, the provider will put together a plan of how many cycles you will need to treat the area of concern.</p><p>In order to see optimal results you may need to treat the same area more than one time. (Renee Burke, MD, Barrington Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting Effectiveness.</em></p><p>CoolSculpting is very effective in decreasing fat pockets in the belly, love handles, back, knees, chin, etc. For many patients one treatment per area works well and is all that is required. If a second treatment for the same area is needed then you should wait 3-4 months before a second treatment. (Joshua L. Fox, MD, Long Island Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cool Sculpting Really Works</h3><p>Cool Sculpting is an effective and safe nonsurgical way to reduce subcutaneous fat. This is fat that can grab and squeeze. The new cool advantage technology is faster and more comfortable. We have NINE machines at our office in Marina Del Rey California and we can do 4 areas at once or 8 cycles in an hour and 10 minutes! No one come close to this.</p><p>We have also done coolsculpting since 2009 and have done more than 50,000 cycles. I have done a number of the FDA studies on the different applicators and have published numerous studies in The Aesthetic Journal. Generally you loose 20-25 percent of the fat which is in the applicators. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Does coolsculpting work?</h4><p>Yes, cool sculpting DOES work on belly fat. The science behind cyrolipolysis is sound and reproducible. That said, it is not the best solution for everyone. For many people, liposuction or even surgery will produce more immediate and better results, and may even be more cost effective, too.</p><p>An in person consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon who can offer you the full range of options is strongly recommended. (Jeffrey D. Wagner, MD, Indianapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting Works!</em></p><p>As someone with first-hand experience providing CoolSculpting to clients, I can say with absolute certainty that yes, for the right type of person, CoolSculpting is absolutely effective. CoolSculpting works best on those with localized deposits of belly fat — that is, noticeable pockets of fat on an otherwise healthy body, especially when those pockets of fat have not responded to diet and exercise.</p><p>I would not recommend CoolSculpting as a solution to large, less defined areas of fat, or for those with below-average levels of body fat.</p><p>In my practice, I typically recommend waiting a month or two between sessions — CoolSculpting works over time, so it makes sense to wait until the results of your first session are clear before scheduling a second.</p><p>However, in terms of health and safety, you can receive a second session as soon as 3 or 4 weeks after your first, depending on how much work you had done. (Kahlil Andrews, MD, Cedar Rapids Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Yes – Coolsculpting really does work</h5><p>Yes, CoolSculpting definitely does work. Each round of treatment usually results in about a 20% or so reduction in the subcutaneous fat in the treated area. With the new applicator heads, Coolsculpting treatment times for the standard applicator are about 35 minutes, so very comparable to other methods.</p><p>Coolsculpting is backed by much more scientific research and publications than any of the other methods on the market today. (Thomas Fiala, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Does CoolSculpting Work</b></p><p>CoolSculpting does work but as noted by others it does not work for everyone. Most candidates that see success with CoolSculpting are those looking to lose the stubborn belly fat and are already practicing a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>It is not meant to be used as a weight loss treatment or to tighten loose skin. There are many variables that go into seeing if this is the right treatment for you so its always best to have a consultation with a certified practice to get the best plan for you. (Randolph Capone, MD, FACS, Baltimore Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Does coolsculpting work and how long in between procedures?</h4><p>We have had Coolsculpting in our practice for many years now and the vast majority of patients are very happy. But they must have reasonable expectations because it is not a replacement for surgery for belly fat reduction.</p><p>The technology has continued to improve and each applicator is around 30 mins for treatment. There is no downtime and patients typically sleep, watch a movie or check their email during their treatments. We usually do around 4-6 treatments per visit and we have people wait until later in the week or the following week for more treatments.</p><p>This treatment really only works well if patients do not gain weight and are committed to the process. Because overlapping treatments lead to better results than a 30% reduction over months. It does not remove poor quality skin and it does not fix a rectus diastasis.</p><p>Abdominoplasty is the best option in this situation. When patients work on core strengthening, physical fitness, and a healthy diet, it makes the results that much better. We have been doing “Fire and Ice” more recently.</p><p>This means that we are doing ThermiSmooth (radiofrequency) to help improve the skin quality, just prior to the Coolsculpting treatment for belly fat reduction. This is followed by acoustic massage to better enhance the result. (Elisa A. Burgess, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>CoolSculpting Works on belly fat for the appropriate candidate</h5><p>With any treatment, some people are better candidates than others. CoolSculpting results can vary, however since starting in 2011, we have seen many clients get great results! CoolSculpting is an FDA cleared treatment and has shown to be effective in permanently removing fat cells through apoptosis (naturally induced fat cell death).</p><p>With new protocols, training, and equipment, as well as 6+ years of clinical experience, we have seen great results. When appropriate, we refer clients who would be better suited with surgery. We absolutely want our clients to get the results they are looking for and will refer to our local plastic surgeons.</p><p>A consultation and physical exam is necessary to determine if someone is a candidate for the treatment. (Kim Thompson, DO, Salem Physician)</p><h4>CoolSculpting Timeline</h4><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_701" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>CoolSculpting is a very individualized procedure. It starts with an appropriate assessment by your provider. After a CoolSculpting treatment, the average amount of fat reduction in the treated area is 20-25%. Some people experience greater reduction and can see up to a 40% decrease in fat, and some people experience less reduction and may only see a 5-10% reduction.</p><p>Your results are affected by the handpiece that is used, the placement on the area to be treated, and the individual. We recommend being re-evaluated 10-12 weeks after your first treatment. The treated area may be significantly smaller or you may only notice minor change; at that point, we can assess whether or not you may want an additional treatment.</p><p>Some people are happy with the small changes, since they notice that their clothes start to fit better. If you desire additional treatments, we would assess the area again so that we are sure to use the appropriate applicator for the treatment area. (Stanley Kovak, MD, Oak Brook Physician)</p></div>
