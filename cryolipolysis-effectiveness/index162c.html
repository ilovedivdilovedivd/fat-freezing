<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><strong>For CoolSculpting to be effective, be sure to see a doctor who is familiar with treating abdominal fat</strong></p><p>CoolSculpting is definitely an effective tool, but make sure you are examined by a doctor who has extensive experience treating abdominal fat. If all the fat is outside of the abdomen, but there is a lot of loose skin, an abdominoplasty might be a better option. (Mario Loomis, MD, Middletown Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Coolsculpting Inquiry</b></p><p>Stubborn fat that does not go away with diet and exercise can be treated with CoolSculpting technology. The procedure uses controlled cooling to target fat cells and eliminate them. The results are permanent. There are fewer fat cells in the area of the body that has been treated.</p><p>However, if you gain weight, the remaining fat cells can still enlarge. The best way to maintain your results is with a healthful diet and a good exercise program. I encourage you to visit a medical professional who has specialized training in Coolsculpting to work with you on the best treatment plan for your specific needs. (Eric C. Cappiello, MD, Chestnut Hill Anesthesiologist)</p><p><i>Is CoolSculpting right For Me?</i></p><p>The best way to determine if you are a candidate for CoolSculpting is to schedule an in person consultation. We offer these assessments free of charge and have been able to help tens of thousands of patients achieve their ideal shape.</p><p>CoolSculpting is an FDA cleared non-invasive procedure which will permanently remove 20-25% of the fat cells form the areas which are treated. The majority of clients find that they will need a minimum of two treatments to achieve best results.</p><p>I would recommend that you schedule a consult with a reputable, doctor owned establishment in your area. We only use highly trained and very experienced registered nurses and nurse practitioners to perform the CoolSculpting treatments, and I would suggest that you seek out an office that meets these standards. (Edward Stokes, MD, West Hollywood Physician)</p><p>coolsculpting selectively freezes fat cells to induce programmed cell death. It is very effective for treating the abdomen and flanks. You need a physical examination by a coolsculpting doc to see if you are a candidate. (Suzanne Kim Doud Galli, MD, PhD, FACS, Washington Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting is FDA approved to treat this area, and it is effective. Consult with a board certified plastic surgeon who performs both Coolsculpting and liposuction to understand your options. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4036" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><b>Coolsculpting is effective and safe</b></p><p>The best results occur in those who are within 10 lbs of there ideal body weight. Our technique at Stillwater Plastic Surgery achieves great success in those that are active, maintain a healthy diet, and stable body weight. (Peter J. Capizzi, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cooling technology will freeze fat cells and you will see up to a 25% reduction of fat in the treated area.</p><p>It will take up to 90 days to see fell results after your treatment. I like to recommend patients re-evaluate at 60 days with their provider to see how your results are progressing and if you need to have a second treatment.</p><p>I would research for practices in your area to find an office that is certified in Coolsculpting and set up a consultation. (Renee Burke, MD, Barrington Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4037" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h4>Coolsculpting and Ideal Weight</h4><p>Coolsculpting is a fabulous machine for freezing the fat bulge. It works extremely well for the abdomen, flanks, and now for outer and inner thighs. If you are not at your ideal weight I would recommend first achieving your weight goal within 20 pounds before pursing coolsculpting.</p><p>When you are ready please consult so board certified dermatologist with a great deal do experience with coolsculpting for the best results. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h5>Effectiveness of CoolSculpting on 290 pound female</h5><p>CoolSculpting is not a weight loss device and is ideally suited for patients that are at or near their ideal body weight with isolated areas of unwanted fat. While it is possible that you might see some improvement with a treatment, your results will be better if you lose some weight prior to treatment.</p><p>You would need to be examined to determine if you might be a candidate for the procedure or not. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Most patients see a 20% reduction of fat in the treated area. We recommend doing 2 treatments for optimal results. I would see a certified center and have a thorough consultation to go over your treatment plan. (Jeffrey B. Wise, MD, FACS, Wayne Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Coolsculpting on Abdomen </em></p><p>Coolsculpting provides a minimal reduction in the treated area, therefore, I would likely recommended 2-3 rounds of treatment on both upper and lower abdomen.</p><p>An in person assessment is always best for the most accurate treatment plan. Please consult with a board certified plastic surgeon. . (Martin Jugenburg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>CoolSculpting for hips (flank / love handles / muffin tops)</h3><p>CoolSculpting is a tried and true method to remove small bulges of fat non-surgically. If you use CoolSculpting to the max, you may achieve a small liposuction like result called “Treat to Transformation.”</p><p>This technique takes many sessions and many hours of your time if you are not a surgical candidate due to illness or no desire for surgery for example. You may consider surgical liposuction which does have OTHER side-effects, risks and complications which are diminished by consulting a well experienced Board Certified Plastic Surgeon but provides many advantages too. (Dean P. Kane, MD, FACS, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Cool Sculpting to reduce muscle mass</h5><p>Cool Sculpting was designed to selectively reduce localized areas of fat. Since muscle and skin have more circulation and are more resistant to cooling effects, they are not injured. The traditional Cool Sculpting cups suction into them a fold of skin and fat but not muscle, so the freezing plates of the applicator have no impact on the muscle.</p><p>Lack of muscle use, ie disuse of your muscles will also atrophy their bulk. Muscle relaxers have been used off-label to reduce the size and mass of the masseter muscle with reasonable results. You may wish to contact a well-qualified and expert Botox / Dysport injector to consider using these muscle relaxers to reduce muscle mass recognizing the side-effects, limitations, risks and complications of their use. (Dean P. Kane, MD, FACS, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Coolsculpting won’t slim back area that is mostly caused by muscle</h3><p>Coolsculpting only works on fat. Muscles have a large blood supply and aren’t cooled to the temperature necessary to cause injury. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>If you are a good candidate, Coolsculpting will not impact the muscular layer. I would recommend seeing a physician to have an in person evalution to make sure you are a suitable candidate. (Omar Ibrahimi, MD, PhD, Stamford Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>Coolsculpting effect on muscle</h5><p>Fat cells are more susceptible than muscle cells to injury from low temperatures and coolsculpting was designed to freeze fat cells selectively. Therefore, coolsculpting will not eliminate muscle bulk. (Suzanne Kim Doud Galli, MD, PhD, FACS, Washington Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolscupting only targets fat cells. It will not impact muscle either positively or negatively. To determine if you are a candidate, have a physical examination by a physician. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolscupting and Cellulite </strong></p><p>Coolsculpting is fat reduction treatment and will not treat cellulite. (Martin Jugenburg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting works for pockets of fat in certain areas of the body. It does not work for cellulite. (Geeta Shah, MD, Chevy Chase Dermatologist)</p><h4>Cool Sculpting for thighs is great</h4><p>Cool Sculpting recently came out with the piece to treat the inner and outer thighs. It works extremely well with no down time. Please find an experienced dermatologist in your area who is board certified for the best cosmetic results. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h4>Best non-invasive fat removal for inner thighs</h4><p>If you are a candidate then CoolSculpting is easily the best non-invasive way to remove fat from the inner thighs. Make sure you schedule a consultation with a provider who has extensive experience in treating the thighs in order to get the best result. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Side effects</strong></p><p>The minimal to no side effects with Coolsculpting make it a great procedure to get rid of stubborn areas of fat. Coolsculpting results usually take 4 -12 weeks. Some areas may require 2-3 sessions to achieve the desired effect. (Patrick M. Moore, MD, Murrieta General Surgeon)</p><h3>Effective treatment</h3><p>Everyone’s body reacts differently to the Coolsculpting treatment. Not everyone will experience the same post-procedure side effects. Not having any side effects does not mean the treatment will not work. Full results can take up to 90 days and you will see a fat reduction of 20%-25% in the treated area.</p><p>I would recommend following up with your provider 60 days after your treatment to re-evaluate and see how your results are progressing, and to see if you will need another treatment.
