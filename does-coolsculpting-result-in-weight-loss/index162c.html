<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>CoolSculpting is a relatively new technology that allows physicians to treat patient’s areas of unwanted fat by applying an applicator to cool the fatty tissue to a point were approximately 20% of the fat in that area will be removed by the body.</p><p>The technology is used to reduce the amount of fat in localized areas to help improve the body’s contour.</p><p>Since fatty tissue does not weigh as much as skin, water, muscle and bone, the reduction typically doesn’t change a person’s weight. (William J. Vinyard, MD, FACS, Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting is not designed to achieve weight loss. Coolsculpting is a nonsurgical fat reduction procedure.</p><p>Many patients remain at a constant weight and achieve the desired results as their problem areas of fat have been addressed.</p><p>To determine if you are a candidate, consult a board certified physician who can offer surgical options as well as coolsculpting so you know that you have the best possible treatment option for you. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, W</p><p><em>Body Sculpting and Weight Loss are not the Same</em></p><p>I am sure many other people have questions that are similar. CoolSculpting is not a weight loss procedure. CoolSculpting is a procedure that, as the name suggests “sculpts” specific areas of the body that seem to hold on to excess adipose tissue.</p><p>A successful CoolSculpting treatment may not show any evidence of weight loss, no change in pounds but it will show the targeted areas are firmer, smaller, and more toned. It is important not to confuse body sculpting with weight loss.</p><p>The best candidates for CoolSculpting are people that are currently healthy and participate in regular exercise and maintain a healthy diet but have specific areas of fat that are stubborn and will not go away no matter how many miles they run or how little they eat.</p><p>If a patient chooses to lose weight with diet and exercise while undergoing CoolSculpting treatments, the two compliment each other. But they are not the same. (Peter J. Capizzi, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting freezes and kills superficial fat. This is “fluffy” and not dense or heavy. The deep, visceral fat is “heavier.” In my office, we have had great results in going down clothing sizes. This is often fat that is more stubborn and less amenable reduction with diet and exercise.</p><p>Also, CoolSculpting is great for smaller areas such as the arms and and chin. These areas make the biggest impression when you look in the mirror and you would not expect to see weight loss from those smaller areas. (Lillian Schapiro, MD, Atlanta OB-GYN)</p><p>CoolSculpting is great for treating focal areas of fat in patients who are within 10-15lbs of their ideal body weight. Once the treatment is done the fat cells are killed and the body will remove them over 3-4 months.</p><p>The amount of fat that is removed is quite small and therefore won’t show up on the scale. If you maintain your weight you will maintain the result. If you gain weight the fat won’t be distributed elsewhere.</p><p>The existing cells just get bigger. (Christopher L. Hess, MD, Fairfax Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting eliminates fat, does not cause weight loss</strong></p><p>CoolSculpting will not necessarily cause you to lose weight. Although it freezes the fat and you eliminate the fat cells, your weight may barely change or not change at all, but your body shape/ look will be affected.</p><p>It is not designed for weight loss, it is designed for fat elimination, which, believe it or not, is different than weight loss. This procedure is used to treat stubborn areas of fat on already healthy patients to improve body contouring. (Craig W. Colville, MD, FACS, Toledo Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Weight Loss With CoolSculpting</strong></p><p>CoolSculpting is not a weight loss treatment. It is more of a body sculpting procedure to treat areas of stubborn fat that are resistant to diet and exercise. After a CoolSculpting treatment, though you will not lose much weight, you will appear slimmer once these pockets of fat have reduced.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4059" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>If you are looking to lose a large amount of weight then this may not be the treatment for you, especially with just one session. You might want to consider dieting and exercise. If you reach the point to where only localized bulges of fat remain then you will be more happy with the results you can achieve with CoolSculpting. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting to get rid of big belly</em></p><p>CoolSculpting can be used to treat the belly (abdomen) but it is not meant to be a weight loss treatment. Good candidates are at or near their ideal body weight, but have isolated areas of unwanted fat.</p><p>An examination of you would really be needed to determine if you might be a good candidate for the procedure. Having a CoolSculpting procedure should not influence any future pregnancy, but pregnancy does usually come with weight gain.</p><p>So, someone who has had CoolSculpting would still gain weight during pregnancy. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Being the same weight means other cells picked up weight you lost when you froze the area and the weight loss is relatively insignificant to start with. CoolSculpting, even more than Lipo, is a spot reduction tool, it is not a weight loss tool.</p><p>See a coolSculpt provider, who is an RN, and works at a Board certified plastic surgeon’s office, and you will be in good hands. (Ayman Hakki, MD, Waldorf Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting is not a weight loss solution. It eliminates 25% of subcutaneous fat only to the treated areas. It may result in loss of inches but not necessarily in weight loss. (Jill Hazen, DO, Princeton Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Non surgical fat reduction post partum</em></p><p>There are many options for non surgical fat reduction with CoolSculpting and SculptSure the best choices. They both eliminate about 25% of the targeted fat. Neither of these produce weight loss, just contouring localized areas of fat.</p><p>Two or three treatment sessions are needed. The fat that is destroyed is permanent and future pregnancies are not affected.</p><p>Please see a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon to assure the best possible results when considering body contouring. (David Finkle, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting overweight patients</em></p><p>I would generally recommend waiting until you reach your goal weight before evaluating which body sculpting procedure would be best for you. CoolSculpting an overweight patient can be extremely costly as it requires multiple sessions in order to see visible results.</p><p>Also, procedures such as CoolSculpting and liposuction do not necessarily tighten loose skin, so in certain cases a surgical procedure such as a tummy tuck, or abdominoplasty, may be a better fit if you have lax or loose skin following extreme weight loss. (Lenore Sikorski, MD, Orange County Dermatologist)</p><h4>CoolSculpting at 285 lbs.</h4><p>I would recommend getting to your goal weight before having any CoolSculpting treatments done. It will most likely save you money as well as give you a better result. It would not be harmful to have CoolSculpting done at your current weight of 285 libs., but the treatments work best in people who have isolated areas of excess fat and the procedure is not a method of weight loss. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting is great for addressing minor problems and is ideal for patients who are in their 10-20lb goal range. (Martin Jugenburg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting is a body contouring device designed for isolated areas of fat. It is effective in reducing the fat that will fit in the treatment head by 25%. In my experience, people who are of similar weight as you would not benefit from CoolSculpting.</p><p>This is because the amount of fat that would be reduced/treatment would be small relative to your size. If you were successful in losing weight, then CoolSculpting might be a helpful additional measure for stubborn areas. (John Zavell, MD, FACS, Toledo Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Is CoolSculpting Right for Me?</h4><p>CoolSculpting is not right for everyone just as surgery is not right for everyone.</p><p>I will say that both surgery and CoolSculpting work best on people that are healthy, eat healthy, and exercise on a regular basis. CoolSculpting may work for you, but it would be best to go in for a consult and discuss your best options with a board certified plastic surgeon or a certified CoolSculpting facility.</p><p>In my experience, the best CS candidates are those that are fit and have just a few stubborn areas of excess adiposity-such as the abdomen, thighs, or bra roll!. (Peter J. Capizzi, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting at 290 pounds.</i></p><p>CoolSculpting works by cooling fat to a level it shrinks and the cells are absorbed and eliminated. Up to 20% of the fat that properly fits within the applicator (the size of a butter stick) will be reduced.</p><p>It is not a weight loss procedure… BUT CoolSculpting has brought satisfaction and great happiness to many patients for which surgery is not an option! My experience is that it has helped patients:</p><ul>
<li>to fit into their shirt sleeves.</li>
<li>reduce the overhang along the bra.</li>
<li>provide a very modest but satisfying improvement around the waist or love-handles</li>
<li>has provided the motivation for many of my patients to change their lifestyle and improve diet and exercise.</li>
</ul><p>Seek a caring and well experienced Board Certified Plastic Surgeon to review your options. (Dean P. Kane, MD, FACS, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
