<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>In the hands of an experienced Dermatologist, CoolSculpting is very safe for the inner and outer thighs. In fact, this is one of the most common areas treated with CoolSculpting. I would find a Dermatologist near you who does this procedure frequently to ensure you get excellent results with your treatments.</p><p>For most patients, it will take 60-90 days to fully appreciate the cosmetic improvement after the procedure is done. Many patients will require more than one treatment. (Jill C. Fichtel, MD, Columbus Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting would work very well in the inner thighs. This is a simple and painless procedure in the office. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p><i>Coolsculpting for inner thighs</i></p><p>The results from Coolsculpting are dependent on a few factors. The areas treated should be large enough, but also pliable enough to fit into the Coolsculpting applicator well. It is not just a question of attaching to a site but also being able to get a sufficient amount of fat drawn into the chamber.</p><p>Secondly, Coolsculpting has its best results with patients that have specific areas of stubborn fat and are close to their goal weight. If a patient is overweight, results from Coolsculpting will be very limited and difficult to appreciate.</p><p>It is always best to get a face to face consult to get the most accurate assessment and decide if Coolsculpting would be the right procedure for you and give you a result you would be pleased with. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>How to improve inner thigh fat bulges?</h5><p>I would say you have two main non-surgical options to reduce the fat on your inner thighs. You could have CoolSculpting or SculpSure. CoolSculpting reduces the fat by freezing it while SculpSure reduces the fat by melting it. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is difficult to say which treatment would be best for you without seeing pictures or performing an in-person assessment. CoolSculpting is an excellent option for both the inner thighs and outer thighs in the appropriate candidates.</p><p>We have seen great success in treating the saddle bags with the new CoolSmooth applicator. However, CoolSculpting will not significantly treat cellulite. There really is no good, non-invasive treatment for cellulite at this time. There are some clinical studies underway which have shown some promise in skin tightening and cellulite improvement with CoolSculpting, however, these are not yet definitive results. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><p>CoolScupting definitely works for excess fat of the lateral and medial thighs, but in my experience, neither CoolSculpting nor liposuction significantly tightens loose skin in these areas. You should have a detailed conversation beforehand with your surgeon about the limitations of the procedure you’re looking at so you know what to expect and what not to expect. (Mario Loomis, MD, Middletown Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>First, cool sculpting and/or liposuction will NOT treat cellulite. If you have excess fat deposits, cool sculpting may be an option for you. Remember, cool sculpting is NOT liposuction. However, is a nonsurgical FDA approved technology to treat excess fat.</p><p>Please visit with a board certified plastic surgeon to learn more about your options. (C. Bob Basu, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4095" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h5>How to Address Cellulite in Thighs</h5><p>I can only advise that liposuction works best in areas where there is still ample skin elasticity to effect sufficient retraction once the fat is removed.</p><p>For that, a better option might be Z-Wave therapy, which stimulates the shrinking of circumference by breaking down cellulite’s fibrous connective tissue so that the fat cells can release their fatty acids. In short, the fat cells deflate.</p><p>To complement this treatment, I would combine it with Carboxy Therapy. This procedure calls for the injection of carbon dioxide gas just below the skin’s surface. The CO2 stimulates circulation and oxygenation to further shrink the subcutaneous tissue and smooth out the skin’s surface. (Hal Michael Bass, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting is FDA cleared to treat inner and outer thigh area</em></p><p>CoolSculpting has announced that it is cleared by the FDA for noninvasive fat reduction in the thigh area. The CoolSmooth applicator which features non-vacuum based cooling that easily treats non-pinchable fat bulges and a CoolFit applicator meant to treat longer fat bulges and hard to reach areas.</p><p>These two applicators allow for complete treatment of inner and outer thigh. However, it is recommended that you set up a one-on-one consultation with a physician to determine if CoolSculpting is right for you.</p><p>CoolSculpting of the inner and outer thighs is one of the more popular treatments that is sought after and has seen tremendous results. (Michael L. Workman, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting for inner / outer thighs</strong></p><p>At this time, patient selection for thigh CoolSculpting is critical because the area being treated needs to fit into the applicator. There is talk about a new applicator that will wrap around the arm and/or leg for better coverage.</p><p>After examination, if the treated doctor thinks that he/she can get a good fit with the applicator, you are fine to go ahead with the treatment. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Coolsculpting can treat your saddle bags</h3><p>We have performed the Coolsculpting procedure on saddle bags with amazing results. Every patient is different, but the best way of determining if you are a good candidate is to undergo a personal assessment with your provider. (Dominic Castellano, MD, Tampa Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Swelling after Coolsculpting</h4><p>Swelling on inner thighs one week after Coolsculpting is completely normal. This is actually very good news. Swelling means that you have initiated an inflammatory response. The inflammatory response is what is going to get rid of up to 25% of your fats cells in this area.</p><p>The swelling will subside over the next few weeks. (Stephanie Martin, MD, Atlanta Orthopaedic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting works through cryolipolysis, the process takes at least a week to complete. Most patient may still feel somewhat swallon 3 weeks post treatment. You usually will notice the swelling and weird skin feeling gone by the end of 4th weeks and see the good results showing off after a month.</p><p>Best results can be seen through second to third months after treatment. (Arash G. Pasha, MD, Kissimmee Physician)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting to get rid of fat on thighs</em></p><p>CoolSculpting is great at removing stubborn fat. As for the thighs, we always recommend a minimum of two treatments. (Alain Michon, MD, Ottawa Physician)</p><p>coolsculpting selectively freezes fat cells to induce programmed cell death. Many patients have had their thighs successfully treated. You may benefit from an in person consultation with a coolsculpting doctor to see if you are a candidate. (Suzanne Kim Doud Galli, MD, PhD, FACS, Washington Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
