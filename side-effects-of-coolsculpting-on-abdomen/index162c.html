<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>CoolSculpting is a noninvasive procedure which produces impressive results for patients who are looking to reduce fat in targetted areas like the abdomen, flanks, and thighs.</p><p>Patients will receive a physical exam and complete a comprehensive health history before CoolSculpting can be recommended to be sure that the patient is a good candidate for the procedure.</p><p>Patients who are pregnant, breast feeding or considering getting pregnant should refrain from treatment until after those conditions are present.</p><p>Patients with certain health concerns will not make good candidates and may be better served by liposuction or possibly diet and exercise. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting is a safe way to loose fat cells in the treatment area. Side effects are minimal. Once the cooling applicator is removed,the treated area is still cold (although numb) and will appear prominent.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1341" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>As the tissue regains its normal temperature and with a slight massage, the normal shape will return leaving just some skin pinkness behind.</p><p>By the next day, many patients do not see or feel much in the treated area; others have described a slight sense of tenderness. Because of the negative suction pressure, the treated area can appear like a “hickey” with some broken capillaries or mild bruising.</p><p>Total resolution of these signs usually takes a few days, but can take up to a couple of weeks. (Frank P. Fechner, MD, Worcester Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Zeltiq CoolSculpting – Are There Any Side Effects?</i></p><p>General side effects from CoolSculpting On Abdomen include tenderness, mild bruising, numbness and swelling in the treated area that can last 1-2 weeks.</p><p>Some people have had moderate discomfort but for the most part our patients have tolerated this procedure with little discomfort. (Brian C. Reuben, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1342" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><i>Side effects are minimal compared to other body contouring options.</i></p><p>One of the reasons our patients love CoolSculpting® is because it’s totally nonsurgical. This means that general anesthesia is not required, which is a big relief for our patients. You also won’t have to worry about incisions and scars.</p><p>The appointment itself doesn’t take very long; some patients report minor discomfort during the procedure initially. Not pain necessarily, but sometimes a pulling or pinching feeling from the CoolSculpting® device. Afterwards, there might be some minor bruising.</p><p>Although it takes longer to see results after CoolSculpting® compared to traditional body contouring with liposuction, the minimal risk of side effects and complications makes this procedure well worth it to most patients. (Glenn M. Davis, MD, FACS, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Side Effects Following CoolSculpting On Abdomen</h3><p>CoolSculpting is a noninvasive technique whereby skin and fat are compressed between two flat surfaces. After it is held in this position, the temperature is dropped to a point that will result in damaging the fat layer enough so that it begins a cycle of dissolving.</p><p>The reduction of fat is sometimes variable and many people need more than one visit to achieve acceptable results. Aside from some soreness, it is unlikely you would experience and complications. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Side effects from Coolsculpting</h4><p>What we have seen after Coolsculpting is occasional “hickeys” / slight bruising and redness this last one- two days. You may also experience slight swelling for a day or two. You will be tender to the touch for about 4-7 days and possibly experience some itching for about 24 hours after about a week when the numbness wears off.</p><p>Hopefully this answers your question!. (Frederick Lester, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>CoolSculpting Side Effects</b></p><p>Most side effects patients experience are minimal and usually self resolve within 2-4 weeks. The most common are swelling, numbness, tenderness and for some pins and needles (nerve based pain).</p><p>Most patients resume normal routine immediately after treatment! (Sheila S. Nazarian, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The side effects most patients experience are tenderness in the treated area which usually subsides in a few days, some experience numbness or tingling, and swelling can also occur. But none of the side effects typically interfere with daily activities. (Alan N. Larsen, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Side Effects of CoolSculpting On Abdomen</h4><p>Zeltiq CoolSculpting is considered a breakthrough in non-surgical fat removal. Using a handpiece and cooling technology, localized fat bulges can be eliminated, up to 25% by 4-8 weeks post-procedure. This is not a procedure that is recommended for obese patients, or to be used as a substitute for liposuction or other surgical fat removal method.</p><p>As a physician, when I see a patient who is interesting in loosing fatty tissue bulges in area of their abdomen, thighs, and ‘love handles’, CoolSculpting is very often my recommendation. My physical exam also needs to show areas of pliable, pinch-able fat tissue, large enough to fit well into the CoolSculpting handpiece to garner a tight suction, to know optimal results can be achieved.</p><p>Side effects of CoolSculpting? Zeltiq CoolSculpting is a quick and safe treatment for fat reduction, with few side effects. During the procedure,only a slight discomfort may be experienced from suction/pulling from the handpiece, and a therapeutic cooling.</p><p>Some patients will experience redness and minor bruising for the first 24-48 hours. There may also be some bit of tingling, numbness, and slight discomfort in the treated area, but these symptoms will resolve completely on their own in the 1-3 weeks following treatment.</p><p>Normal activities can usually resume the day after your CoolSculpting, and quite often, my patients are able to return to work the same day as their treatment. (Narin (Joe) Apisarnthanarax, MD, Houston Dermatologist)</p><h3>Zeltiq has few side effects</h3><p>Zeltiq has few side effects mostly llimited to localized soreness and tenderness for a few days at the treatment site.</p><p>Some patients also have localized bruising from the pulling of the adaptor on the skin to freeze the fat.</p><p>All of these side effects are temporary and resolve in approximately a week. The fat freezing where 20 percent of the fat in a given area is gone is permanent! (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h5>Coolsculpting side effects</h5><p>Side effects of Coolsculpting can include bruising, numbness, and discomfort. However, if they occur the effects usually resolve in 1-3 weeks. (Jeffrey E. Schreiber, MD, FACS, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1347" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Some side effects include, but are not limited to:</p><ol>
<li>bruising for up to three weeks or more</li>
<li>soreness for several weeks</li>
<li>sensitivity or numbness for several weeks</li>
<li>slight swelling</li>
<li>lack of desired improvement</li>
</ol><p>CoolSculpting On Abdomen by Zeltiq is a very safe treatment and the majority of patients receive good results. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Zeltiq Coolsculpting- what to expect</h4><p>During the CoolSculpting procedure there is very little discomfort, generally in the one hour treatment the discomfort is only in the first few minutes of the initial phase when the area is getting cold. The discomfort during and after the procedure that may be related to suction seems to depend on how thin the patient is…the less there is to draw up in to the chamber and subsequently freeze the more a person may feel it. After the procedure you may experience some bruising, swelling, a transient pins and needles sensation (like you may get when your foot falls asleep and then starts ‘waking up’) and some dull achiness.</p><p>Patients aren’t generally limited from their normal activities after the treatment as a result of discomfort. Our patients have been extremely happy with the results and none have put off a second treatment due to side effects from the first….they are not only ready and excited for their second treatments but usually add some new areas as well. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Coolsculpting side effects</h4><p>During the coolsculpting procedure, there is minimal discomfort, if at all. After the procedure, for a few weeks , there may be cutaneous transient hypersensitivity or numbness. Occasionally, there is some soreness in the treated area.</p><p>Also, mild bruising on the skin may occur. Overall side effects are minimal and self-limited. (Steven Hacker, MD, West Palm Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Zeltiq is a non-invasive fat reduction device which may improve the overall volume of fat by amout 20-25% in the given treated area. There are only a few papers on the subject and asymmetry may be the biggest issue. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Following the procedure, typical side effects may include temporary numbness, redness of the area, swelling, tingling, and slight bruising. There is no downtime following the procedure so you will be able to go on with normal activities. (John A. Kotis, DO, FACS, FACOS, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
