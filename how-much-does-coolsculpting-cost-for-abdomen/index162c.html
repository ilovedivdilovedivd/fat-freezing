<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Zeltiq is a great, non-invasive method to get rid of isolated fat bulges along the abdomen.</p><p>The cost in Orange County is around 600-800 dollars per cycle. So for the love handles or the belly area, you will consider that two cycles.</p><p>Each cycle takes one hour. You will have good results with one treatment, but should expect two treatments about 2-3 months apart.</p><p>Most patients will see about 20-30% fat reduction. We recently got a new larger handle in our office that can treat the two central abdomen area at the same time and the cost is less for the patient– about 1200-1500 dollars for the one hour treatment. (Margaret Mann, MD, Cleveland Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Cost of coolsculpting</h4><p>The price of coolsculpting depends in part on the number and type of applicators and cycles required to achieve your results.</p><p>For example, treating my own abdomen and flanks required one large coolmax cycle for my lower abdomen, two rounds each of two coolcore for the upper abdomen and two coolcurve for my flanks, then finally one cooladvantage core for the residual on my mid-upper abdomen.</p><p>That program would be equivalent to 10 cycles. Your physician and her staff can outline a recommended ‘treat to transform’ program for you that outlines the number of cycles. Purchasing a package of cycles at once will generally give you a better price per cycle than purchasing them individually.</p><p>Most important however, is remembering that you are not paying just for the commodity, the applicator cycle, but for the expertise of the physician and her staff in making sure it is the right treatment for you and if so, designing the program.</p><p>Remember also, that not all practices have the most up to date applicators and may not be able to offer you the most effective or efficient treatment. (Heidi A. Waldorf, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h5>CoolSculpting Costs</h5><p>A typical CoolSculpting session is one hour. The procedure is performed by first selecting the appropriate head based on the anatomic location being treated. Suction is then applied and the skin and fat fold is brought into the suction head.</p><p>It is then compressed between two plates giving it a feeling of being pinched. After the skin and fat layer is secured between the two plates, the temperature is dropped sufficiently to freeze the fat.</p><p>The device is left in place, treating the patient for one hour. Multiple areas can be treated at the same session, each receiving a one-hour treatment. Most patients report a significant pinching feeling for the first five to ten minutes.</p><p>Following this, as the tissues are cooled, they discomfort subsides. Afterward, patients report variable degrees and lengths of time of discomfort. Some people notice a mild discomfort for a few days and others report more significant discomfort for up to two weeks.</p><p>Usually, bruising afterward is minimal, if any. Common areas treated are the abdomen, the flanks or love handles, and the upper back fat along the bra line. If there is sufficient tissue to be treated in the arm area, it can be used for excess fat in the underarm area.</p><p>Usually, it is not utilized in the lateral thigh fat because is it not possible to pinch this fat and subsequently treat it. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Price of CoolSculpting</h5><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_56" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Like any other treatment — surgical or non-surgical — we provide, CoolSculpting is specific to YOU. At your consultation we determine which direction the fat pad(s) lay, the size, the contour, etc.</p><p>As an example some abdomens may just require one CoolSculpting cycle (about the size of a small shoebox), while others require three or four.</p><p>As a certified practice of Zeltiq, the makers of CoolSculpting, we adhere to strict pricing guidelines. Our regular price for one cycle is $700. We offer significant savings for those choosing to treat multiple areas, and we typically offer monthly specials for single cycles.</p><p>We have treated hundreds of patients with CoolSculpting and as a result, their friends and family too. Ask about our referral program at your next visit.</p><p>Be sure your CoolSculpting technician is certified by Zeltiq, and as always be sure your doctor is Board Certified in Plastic Surgery, a specialty recognized officially by the American Board of Medical Specialties, and is a Member Surgeon of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.</p><p>That way, should CoolSculpting not be the best option for you, or should you have the privilege of choosing from multiple options like liposuction or a tummy tuck, your physician can accommodate you. (Joseph E. Mark, MD, Rochester Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>CoolSculpting is Most Effective For Bulges of Fat</h3><p>Pricing will differ per geographic location and doctor. Some doctors price the treatments per applicator size and others price per area. The median price for one treatment is $750 – $1500. Typically, our patients notice about a 25% reduction of fat in the area that has been treated.</p><p>Most decide to perform an overlap treatment or double treatment to maximize the results. We have seen great success in the abdomen & flanks although, other areas of fat can be treated with CoolSculpting. (Mitchell F. Grasseschi, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Cost of coolsculpting in Michigan</i></p><p>The price of coolsculpting treatment is somewhat controlled by the manafacturer. However, practices often have discounts available. The small applicator ranges from 600-900 dollars depending on the area being treated and current discounts. The vast majority of our patients have 2-6 applicators selected as a time.</p><p>This if often referred to as a “treatment to transformation” package. The discounts on this package can amount to up to 1500 off. Coolsculpting is best for the love handle, abdomen, chin, and bra roll areas. (Pramit Malhotra, MD, Ann Arbor Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>CoolSculpting Cost Is Often Much Less Than Lipo</h5><p>The charge depends on the number of “sites” treated. Our fee is $750 per site. We’ll usually treat 4-8 sites in an abdomen, 2-4 sites for the waist or bra folds, usually 4 sites for the inner or outer thighs, etc.</p><p>When we treat three or more sites, there is a discount of 5-10% We discount 20% when treating the same area a second time. In my experience, the cost to achieve a result similar to what I would get from liposuction is significantly less, often half, especially since it is done in the office with no anesthesia, so you save facility and anesthesia charges. (Mario Loomis, MD, Middletown Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Cost of CoolSculpting non-invasive fat reduction</h4><p>CoolSculpting has two different sizes of applicators – a small and a large. The large applicator is 2.5x the size of the small applicator. Most of our CoolSculpting clients do a package of treatments including one large application and two small applications.</p><p>If they purchase this package, they are typically looking to treat along their waistband – the lower abdomen and their love handles. The large application would be for the lower abdomen and the small applications would cover each of the love handles.</p><p>Without any package discounts, the large application is $1400 and the small application is $700. If someone were to purchase the package as described above, they would receive a 10% package discount. (Jeffrey W. Hall, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Cost of CoolSculpting</strong></p><p>The price for CoolSculpting to reduce fat on the body by freezing, may be different depending on the location of the medical practice within the U. S. The larger applicator which is used for the abdomen in some cases, costs the same as using two smaller applicators for the lovehandles, so in the end, both lovehandels cost the same as the abdomen.</p><p>In some cases the abdomen only needs a smaller applicator and then the cost can be half, while in other cases some patients need the larger applicator on the lower abdomen and a smaller applicator on the upper abdomen so the cost can be 50% more. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p></div>
