<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><i>You’ll See CoolSculpting Results In Weeks to Months</i></p><p>It usually takes at least two to three weeks after your CoolSculpting session before your body has eliminated enough fat cells for results to be visible.</p><p>While it is possible that you could see a decrease in fat after one week, your guess that you are just noticing a difference in the amount of swelling is probably correct.</p><p>Nevertheless, your healing seems to be on schedule and you will undoubtedly be pleased with your final results. Two weeks after this first session you can go ahead and book your next CoolSculpting treatment with a board-certified dermatologist. (Melda A. Isaac, MD, Washington DC Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>No results from coolsculpting</strong></p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4179" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It takes 3 and sometimes 4 months to see the results from coolsculpting I would be patient and give it some more time. The protocol for coolsculpting is to treat each area twice. You should talk with your provider about your concerns.</p><p>we have been doing coolsculpting for about 10 years and have seen some amazing results. (Jean M. Casello, MD, Northborough Physician)</p><p>It is understandable if you are frustrated due to lack of results . Coolsculpting takes 3 months for final results , which you still have another month. Regardless, you appear to be an adequate candidate for treatment success.</p><p>There are some people respond less to a non invasive treatment and small set of people who are non responders . In my practice , I caution treating multiple areas at once until we know you are a “good responder with successful results”.</p><p>I also offer a rebate off of liposuction for those individuals who have unsatisfactory coolsculpting results. I would suggest patience as you still have a month before results finalize. If you are then unsatisfied you may want to seek if the practice can offer you liposuction. (Drew Varano, MD, Washington DC Physician)</p><h4>CoolSculpting Results</h4><p>It would be difficult to determine any visible results only 1 week after a CoolSculpting treatment, as what you are seeing may just be a reduction in any swelling that may have occurred. Many patients notice a difference just three weeks after their treatment, with optimal results becoming visible after 2 months.</p><p>It may be best to wait a few more weeks and follow up with your treatment provider before judging the results of your treatment. (Karen Beasley, MD, Baltimore Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>In many cases, up to three CoolSculpting® treatment sessions spaced several weeks apart may be necessary in order to achieve the best results. At our practice, we use the “stacking” technique to get better results in a single session instead.</p><p>Another possible concern is that CoolSculpting® won’t address excess skin, so if you do lose weight in your chin area, you may notice that the appearance of sagging skin becomes a larger concern. It’s never a bad idea to get a second opinion, especially if you weren’t happy with your initial results.</p><p>I would suggest consulting another board-certified plastic surgeon for a more in-depth assessment of your needs and the best treatment approach. (Jennifer Harrington, MD, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting can help reduce fat in a buttock</em></p><p>If the fat in the buttock is localized and the applicator can fit, then the fat can be reduced. There may not be a perfect reduction to the shape you want as CoolSculpting is works on focal, not global areas. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Results after 1 week is rare, but seeing is believing</h3><p>Usually after the treatment the area treated feels firm and swollen. When the swelling subsides and contraction occurs it usually takes 2 to 4 months for the full effect. Of course, how intense the settings were and how many treatments (at least 2cycles) also has to be taken into account. (Peter J. Capizzi, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Coolsculpting results after 1 week</h3><p>Patients will begin to see results in 3 to 4 weeks from coolsculpting. The swelling may make assessment more difficult in the first couple of weeks. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4183" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><em>Coolsculpting – How soon do you see results</em></p><p>It would be unlikely that you are seeing a result from Coolsculpting in just one week, and I agree that you are probably just noticing the relative difference from the swelling going down.</p><p>Coolsculpting works by freezing the fat to a critical temperature until the fat undergoes apoptosis (cell death) and then it is removed from the body by way of the lymphatic system.</p><p>This process takes about 3 months to be complete. We do have many patients saying they see beginning results at 2 to 4 weeks and we use a radiofrequency device to heat and manipulate the fat to accelerate the process and tighten the skin.</p><p>But it still takes at least 2 weeks to really start to see the meaningful results that Coolsculpting produces. So be patient and soon enough you will see your new body taking shape. (Paul Flashner, MD, Boston Physician)</p><p><i>Early results</i></p><p>It is possible to see some improvement, but not likely. At one week after the destroyed fat cells are still being cleared from the treated area and there is likely still swelling and inflammation. The final results are closer to 3-6 month after treatment. (Michelle Ellern, DO, Livingston Physician)</p><h5>Coolsculpting and Over the Counter Treatments</h5><p>Coolsculpting is a procedure that requires a set up and a machine that is used to treat areas of unwanted fat. This is not something avaialble over the counter and should be performed by a well trained phyisician who specializse in body shaping. (Jason Emer, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>You do need an exam by a physician who has experience in treating patients with coolsulpting to obtain the best results. Every body is different and evaluating the fatty areas to be treated is critical to come up with a treatment plan.</p><p>Coolsculpting does work when applied to the right patient and area. (Josh Olson, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting absolutely works! </i></p><p>CoolSculpting clearly works to reduce fat in the areas treated. It is a process of carefully controlled cooling done under medical supervision. The CoolSculpting machines designed and sold by Zeltiq are FDA approved for this treatment.</p><p>The process is carefully controlled to target fat while protecting skin, muscle, nerves and vessels. CoolSculpting is absolutely not an over the counter treatment. While a fabulous treatment with no downtime when done in an appropriate medical setting, using counterfeit machines or attempting to apply cold to yourself with ice packs for instance, could cause considerable injury. (Elizabeth Slass Lee, MD, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting treatments are either ine hour or two hours per site. Thirty minutes is not ling enough to get the treated area down to a temperature low enough for the cells to disappear. I am not surprised this was not effective for you. (Sheryl D. Clark, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p>With a 30 minutes treatment, Coolsculpting will provide only minimal results. One region will require a 1 hour treatment before full efficacy is achieved.</p><p>If you had Venus Freeze, then a series of treatments (usually 8 to 10) will be required. (Frank P. Fechner, MD, Worcester Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Does CoolSculpting have to hurt to be effective?</b></p><p>Everyone responds differently to CoolSculpting. Pain is not an indicator of success or failure of the treatment. (Carmen Kavali, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Each patient has a different experience with Coolsculpting during and after the procedure. Your amount of discomfort should not correlate with whether or not you see results. (Sanjiv Kayastha, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Neither Liposuction or coolsculpting causes redistribution of fat cells, if it did I doubt it would be a very popular procedure. But, unfortunately our bodies continue to age and if you gain weight fat can accumulate in all areas of the body. (Reps B. Sundin, MD, Washington DC Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>If you were to gain a considerable amount of weight it might be noticed more elsewhere. Cool sculpting is ideal for people within 20-30lbs of their ideal/goal weight. Most physicians will do a free consult for you to discuss your body specifically. (Nicholas Gentry, MD, Fayetteville Physician)</p><p>CoolSculpting permanently removes fat cells in the treated area. If weight gain occurs, the remaining cells in that area can get larger, but will not multiply. Fat cells in other areas of the body can also get larger, but not substantially more just because another area was treated. (Pamela Kimbrough, MD, Ardmore OB-GYN)</p><h5>Untreated areas</h5><p>With CoolSculpting we are targeting an area of fat cells. If you were for example to treat your abdomen, you would notice a reduction in fat cells. Now if you were to gain weight you may notice that untreated areas getting bigger, this is because there are more fat cells to increase in size.</p><p>That is why it is a good idea to keep up with a good diet and exercise routine to help maintain results. (R. Brannon Claytor, MD, FACS, Bryn Mawr Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>#Coolsculpting for belly pooch</em></p><p>Your physical examination is most important in determining whether you are a candidate for Coolsculpting and how many cycles are needed, which in turn determines cost. ( I am not familiar with Lapex/Zerona lasers).</p><p>You need to be examined to ensure that the “pooch” is not lax muscles that need repairing with a tuck-see a plastic surgeon. If you can pinch a significant amount of tissue that is able to be drawn into the applicators, typically 4 cycles (considered one session) is needed.</p><p>Look for providers that have had the advanced training of Coolsculpting University, have multiple machines (to shorten treatment time & a sign of an experienced & busy CS center), and have the advantage applicators (shortens treatment times, less painful, more sizes that might possibly reduce the number of cycles/cost). (Vaishali B. Doolabh, MD, FACS, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
