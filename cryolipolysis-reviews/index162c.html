<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>– I had 3 large applicators done 8 days ago, I think that giving birth is less painfull than the terrible pain i still have. Can’t sleep, can’t sit and am so very happy that I am retired, it would be impossible to work, I cannot even wear my clothes. I would need 2 sizes bigger. I am definitely NOT doing any more treatments, even if it looks worse than I started off with. I think that it is ridiculous that nobody tells you in advance. You see pictures of people reading or working on i-pad…. perhaps if you take one small one that is realistic…Have a good advice for anybody who wants to do cryolipolysis, talk to people who had the treatment not to doctors.<br>
– Let me start my saying that I am an RN and I work for a surgeon and at our office we recently started offering cryolipolysis. I am a firm believer that in order for me to really explain to a patient what a treatment will feel like, I have to go through it myself. With that being said, I began my treatment exactly one week ago and started experiencing the nerve pains 4 days ago (once the numbness went away). As a healthcare provider this concerned me because I am new to this cryolipolysis procedure and have only actually done a couple of them for patients. Ice seems to help although I have not yet tried compression garments. My boss finally prescribed me some gabapentin today and that helps with the shooting pains although my stomach still feels very tender. The cryolipolysis rep was in the office today as well and she said this sometimes happens and is normal. I know it sucks especially if this side effect wasn’t explain before you purchased the treatments, however the pain does not last for very long and I do believe the end result will be worth it. Drink lots of water, use your ice packs, and see about having a nerve block prescribed!<br>
–  I had pain from Saturday to Wednesday with the worst pain being on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. I only took the gabapentin twice. It made a significant difference for the worst of the pain but I have to say that the ice packs were the most helpful. For ice packs, I used dish towels soaked in water and then frozen for 20-30 minutes. It stays cold for a long time plus it doesn’t take long to freeze. I then put the towels in a freezer size ziplock bag and then tucked it into my yoga pants. No biggie. I avoided taking too much of the gabapentin just because I know that the side effects are serious. Keep in mind that 90% of the side effects listed are from long term use.</p><p>– I had the treatment 5 days ago and the pain is excruciating it feels like I got stabbed and my stomach is in knots. even just lying on my back I want to cry. I have been taking advil nonstop but it doesn’t help at all. If I knew it would be this painful I would NOT have gotten the treatment, I have literally been in tears every night this is so miserable. when will I start to feel normal again?</p><p>– My BAD pain went away around day 7 or 8. I took Percocet at night to ease the pain enough to sleep and just toughed it out with Aleve during the day. I am 7 weeks post freeze and I CAN tell a difference in my lower abdomen though, so maybe the pain was worth it after all?<br>
– The worst thing I have ever experienced in my life… I have been in bed for 2 days which isn’t even comfortable but standing and moving around is worse. I feel useless and think it’s ridiculous this was ever put on the market and has been allowed to be represented as pain free….</p><p>– So I tried to do cool sculpting today on my lower abdomen with the large applicator and not even thirty seconds into it I was in such severe pain that I literally started to pass out. Attempted again ten minutes later and just could not do it. Anyone have this much pain when they put the applicator on?</p><p>– I have a really high tolerance for pain, but having the applicator turned on just about brought me off the table. I told the girl I couldn’t believe they were doing this procedure without some sort of sedation and or pain med. It really was awful, but if you can tough it out for 5-10min it does get better. I had my upper & lower abdomen cryolipolysis done the same day, and the upper was a bit worse than the lower.<br>

</div>– I am in my sixth day of excruciating pain from cryolipolysis. Nothing works to numb the pain. The only thing that has helped was taking a high dosage of narcotics to knock me out. Even that only lasts four hours. I haven’t slept through the night in a week. The recovery from this cryolipolysis procedure is torture (and I’ve given birth three times).
<p>– I can relate, as it has been 7 very painful days for me. I had my cryolipolysis on 12/05/17 and had I known of the throbbing pain in advance…I would have avoided the holiday timeline. However, I kept researching and just found this topic as it is so relevant to ME. I hope to see some results as I can not wear any if my clothes at the moment. Sensitive to the touch… So I’m working from home now.<br>
– I’ve had it done before and despite the pain it does work and for way less pain and money than any other procedure that actually is effective!</p><p>–  had three areas treated at the same time (flanks, lower abdomen) the abdomen was the only area where I experienced severe pain. I was getting concerned by te swelling taking so long, that the true results could be an illusion due to being swollen for so long. I really appreciate the positive feedback…can’t wait to see the end results.</p><p>– For me, the terrible, stabbing pain lasted from December 6th until January 3rd. That was the first day I could bear to be without ice packs constantly…24/7. Made for a very awkward and awful trip to visit my parents in Florida over Christmas. Compression garments hurt tremendously. No results yet. I’m working out like crazy and eating well. I’m hopeful it was worth it, but I would not have done it had I known how much it hurts. I’m definitely not doing my second round of treatments. I’d be crazy to go through that again.</p><p>– For me it was bad the first week only however I you tubed lymphatic massage and did it everyday for at least 5 min which helped and reduced my swelling within a week. I did not have to take pain meds or use ice packs. At this point if you’re still having pain which is uncommon you should return to the practitioner as this is a rare instance. Do try massage though it does help!</p><p>– I had this cryolipolysis procedure done on my lower abdomen. When they first attached the machine I truly thought I could not do this. It was incredibly painful. I thought I might pass out. The technician assured me that it will ease up in 8 minutes and that she couldn’t stop it once started so I decided to “buck up” and proceed. It did get easier after about 8 minutes and I tried to calm myself and just hope I hadn’t made a big mistake. That was the first day. And after I left I thought this isn’t so bad. Well, since the second day I have had incredible swelling, bruising and then the nerve pains started and I’ve had those now for 7 days. I finally called the doctor’s office on the 7th day and said I can’t take this anymore. They prescribed the Gabapentin and I took one last night and applied an ice pack. It really seems to have helped. Today I am very sore but the nerve pains are not as intense. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PROCEDURE. I WOULD NEVER DO IT AGAIN. I don’t know what the final result will be since I am only 7 days post, but the side effects have impacted my every day life and right now my feeling is it’s just not worth it.</p><p>– I just had the cryolipolysis procedure done 12-12 and have had if done 2 years ago and experienced similar pain! This time I had more pan during the procedure, significant swelling and sensitivity afterwards which makes it uncomfortable for me to button my pants and I’ve started getting the sharp stabbing nerve pains for the past day. Starting the first day I’ve been doing lymphatic massage which significantly helped reduce most of the swelling. The I’ve been doing a deeper massage in small circles around my belly button and those have both helped with the soreness and pain but not with the stabbing pains.</p><p>– I did it yesterday and I have no bruise but I am burned. Even with bobles. They told me it’s normal, but I don’t see anyone with this problem. Do u guys only have bruises? Or burn as well? </p><p>– No visible burn but there was a feeling of burning that lasted for almost two weeks. It has been two weeks now and I have just come through my 10-12 days of pain…. The key to surviving it truly is an ice pack! Make sure you have a couple on hand so you can trade them out. It made a world of difference and gave me some relief while I had it on. Also wearing a control top cami or compression top helps for moving around. Also I noticed that the stabbing pain was way more intense in the days following especially around my laparoscopic scar sites on my stomach. So if you have any scarring on the tummy and considering doing this be prepared for some good tight stabbing pains. So glad that is over! </p><p>– Can anyone also give a definite time frame as when the pain does finally decrease? I am on my 6th day and haven’t really slept this week! I have a super high tolerance to pain as I live with Migraines and have had other ailments. This pain feels alot like the time I had shingles. I have been using heat and light therapy, as well as ice and compression. I go back within 3 weeks for a second cryolipolysis procedure and I don’t think I will want to if this irritating pain doesn’t go away soon. I have to say that the nurses all had some type of procedure done and they did let me know that it wasn’t fun and one of them almost threw up from the pain. They did tell me that they would go through it again. So with that info I felt that this pain I am feeling must not last forever???</p><p>– I was told I’m a good candiate because reasonably fit with recalcitrant lower belly (which I’ve had my whole life — I’m 51 yo). I opted to have my lower abs done with two small handpieces (recommended by the technician). The cryolipolysis procedure wasn’t as bad as others describe. I just knitted and listened to podcasts. The massage was a little tender, but I didn’t bruise. It’s now Day2 and I’m a little bit sore (like a really intense ab workout) and feel a little bloated, but I don’t look bad. I was told to not expect to see the final result for 3-4months. I do wonder if I’ll get this terrible pain others describe and hope not. Currently, I’m a little tender and numb, but able to wear my clothes and workout. Bending over reminds me of it. Sleep is fine. I had my tonsils out last year and THAT was the worst pain I can imagine for 10 days postop.</p><p>– My pain started four days after the cryolipolysis and lasted for 4 solid weeks. It was hell! I’m 7.5 weeks post cryolipolysis and no results yet. The center of my abs on the skin is still numb with no pain. I am still hopeful I’ll see results, but I refused the second set of treatments and got my money back.</p><p>– I did okay until they after they massage my area, then I broke out in a sweat from the pain and tried to “walk it off”…that subsided by the time the did the other abdominal side. They used the big applicator on the left then on the right side..(each one was considered as two spots so they counted the two hours as four spots…a 2hr treatment. again after the 2nd treatment and the nurse massaged the area, knee jerking pain again. We drove 120 miles home and I went to work the next day, dealing with the needle like pains that had already started. Now I am six days into it and even though sure I can go about my business and even shampooed carpets and technically can function, the nerve pain is crazy and I can’t hardly stand it. I haven’t slept much in those 6 days. I would sure hate this to last four weeks! I think I am going to call the Dr. on Monday and see what they have to say.</p><p>– It took me 15 days before I could wear my normal clothes without pain. The “Flanks” …, no issues, but The “Abdomen” was a beast! Please do not usr HEAT, it will increase the pain, the best method was the TIGER pain patch sold over the counter at CVS. The good news is that you will start seeing results within 30days,and due to the amount of pain it won’t matter because it will feel as if you’ve gained due to the inability to exercise as usual. In addition, I used a vegan based protein called shakeology to balance my body with proper nutrients to expedite the expulsion of the frozen fats and to restore your energy. I wish you the best and promising result….</p></div>
