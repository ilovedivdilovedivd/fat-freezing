<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Freeze Sculpting definitely works, but you have to be a good candidate for it. Whether or not you are a good candidate depends on how pinchable the fat is. You can have a lot of fat, but if it’s not pinchable, then you won’t really see the benefits of treatment.</p><p>We are selective about the patients we treat because we want clients to have the best results. This is why it’s important to get a personal evaluation by an experienced CoolSculpting provider. (Garry K. Kim, MD, Pasadena Internist)</p><h4>Coolsculpting treat to transform protocol can really sculpt your body</h4><p>Coolsculpting does work! It has been proven by over 3 million treatments worldwide and in over 60 publications.</p><p>No other noninvasive fat reduction treatment has that amount of treatments or data behind it. The key is making a plan with your physician and her ‘coolsculptress’ (coolsculpting expert).</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_710" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The treatment plan should include the full area that concerns you. If you dislike your lower abdomen, don’t ignore your flanks and hips — together they make up your waist and can make the difference between closing a zipper easily or filling out but not bursting out of a skirt or pants.</p><p>With recent advances, we can treat more areas, better and faster. My office has dualsculpting (two coolsculpting machines that can be used simultaneously on different areas to speed treatment time) and a zimmer z wave (radiowave device used instead of manual massage to break up the ice crystals in the fat cells immediately after treatment so you achieve results faster).</p><p>You can do multiple areas on the same day or spread over days or weeks. Results start to be evident about a month after treatment and improve until about 3 months. That is the time to retreat areas where you want further sculpting. (Heidi A. Waldorf, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p><em>Freeze Sculpting session spacing</em></p><p>I recommend waiting 2-3 months between sessions, because results continue to improve over this period of time. However, a second session can be done one month later if desired. (Kally Papantoniou, MD, FAAD, Great Neck Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Coolsculpting Effectiveness</em></p><p>This is an FDA and proven fat loss procedure that has research proven effectiveness. Beyond the research there are countless consumers who continue to report positive results. However, see the results for yourself. There are many before and after photos on real self that show results. (Maiysha Clairborne, MD, Atlanta Family Physician)</p><p><i>Freeze Sculpting works</i></p><p>Coolsculpting is a fat-freezing method that uses controlled cooling to get rid of stubborn fat. You will see results after about 3 months. You can wait a week between treatments. You can add Vanquish or Cellutone for even better results.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_712" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>We call this “Fire & Ice.”(Jason Emer, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Freeze Sculpting absolutely works to permanently decrease the number of fat cells in the treated area. This is important because we make no new fat cells as adults. We gain weight by increasing the size of the cells we have.</p><p>And we as we lose weight, fat fells shrinvk in size, but the NUMBER of cells does not change with weight fluctuation. Freeze Sculpting is the best and most predictable way to decrease the number of fat cells without invasive techniques or surgery.</p><p>And it works better IMO than other technologies because fat cells respond to cold by going into programmed cell death, called “apostosis.” And because we make no new fat cells, once those cells are gone, they are gone for good.</p><p>Maintain your body weight where it was at your treatment time, and those results will be long term. That having been said, CoolSculpting is not a weight-loss alternative, it is a body shaping process. If your weight is stable and there are bulges that you struggle with always, you know, the spots where you gain first and lose last, Freeze Sculpting may be perfect for you.</p><p>A common cause of less than optimal results is poorly planned treatment with too few cycles. Based on applicator size, it is often necessary to have several overlapping cycles to fully treat any given area. CoolSculpting is rarely a “one and done” procedure. But a well designed treatment protocol works fabulously to noninvasively shape and smooth. (Elizabeth Slass Lee, MD, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>in our opinion, and in over 2000 treatments, CoolSculpting is the best non invasive, FDA approved treatment for fat reduction! However, a proper consultation, assessment and patient selection is key. As CoolSculpting reduces 20-25% of fat to the area treated, some patients return for a 2nd treatment of the same area, but for those with more fat that they want to lose, we might recommend SmartLipo.</p><p>Still with no general anesthesia (just local and by mouth meds), we melt the fat, remove it with liposuction then heat the skin for skin tightening. SmartLipo is especially best for clients concerned with skin laxity and want to tightening. (Emerico Csepanyi, MD, Newport Beach Physician)</p><h3>Does CoolSculpting Really Work?</h3><p>Coolsculpting really does work on the ideal candidate. The coolsculpting technology uses controlled cooling to target and kill fat cells, reducing them from 20% – 25% in the treated area. Results may be seen as early as 1 month but the most drastic results are seen in 3 months.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_715" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It is recommended that you consult with a board certified plastic surgeon to discuss your goals and to determine if coolsculpting is the right treatment for you. (Martin Jugenburg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Does Freeze Sculpting really work and time between</em></p><p>In my Plastic Surgery practice there was always a gap for those patients who wanted fat reduction, but for one or other reason, were not going to have liposuction. Their requirement for fat reduction did not go away. I just did not have anything reputable, scientifically based, that I trusted, to offer them. The reason I brought CoolSculpting into my practice was that it does work. The fat cells are naturally metabolised by the body and are gone.</p><p>Quite soon after I bought the first machine, I bought another so that we could treat 2 areas at the same time to save time for the patient.</p><p>Since then we have also implemented additional technology that allows some treatments to be effective in half the time.</p><p>It just depends on which applicators are correct for your specific areas that you are concerned about. It is really gratifying to see how happy patients are as they get better sculpted bodies. When I first learned about this type of fat freezing I thought it was only appropriate for slim people who had an area of fat that did not respond to diet and exercise(like the area we all pinch on the side near our waists).</p><p>Over the years I have come to realise that this is just as appropriate for patients who are not slim necessarily, but who just want to look better or sculpt some areas. They key is in good assessment initially so that appropriate treatment sessions are planned, and that expected expectations of outcomes are set.</p><p>We see noticeable results from 4 weeks, but like to retreat after 6-12 weeks, so that we have maximum result before another session is planned to the same area.</p><p>It depends on a few factors, and the site of treatment makes a difference. (Mark Edinburg, MBBCH, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Positive results</h3><p>Coolsculpting is effective when done on an appropriate candidate, and proper applicator selection and placement. Ask lots of questions during your custom patient consult, and read reviews of each office you go. Look for a Certified Practicing professional.</p><p>Patients see typically about 20-22% fat reduction in treated areas in as little as 4 weeks. There is only a waiting time between sessions when treating the SAME area, and that is minimally 30 days. Doing multiple areas in the same day is very common for patients.</p><p>Dual sculpting now reduces the time frame needed for patients as well. (Jennifer Cova, DO, Dayton Physician)</p><p><em>Freeze Sculpting Results</em></p><p>I have significant experience working with Coolsculpting and it is a safe and effective treatment when applied by a trained professional. While it takes about 6 weeks to see results, the results are long-lasting. Most clients need 1-2 treatments to see results, but some require more.</p><p>While Coolsculpting might feel uncomfortable, there is very little pain involved. It is recommended to wait 3-4 months between sessions. (Justin Harper, MD, Columbus Physician)</p><h3>Yes! Freeze Sculpting Works!</h3><p>CoolSculpting is an extremely effective and safe treatment for the reduction of fat. It is an FDA cleared treatment that is noninvasive with no down time. The treatment uses controlled cooling to damage and kill fat cells.</p><p>Over time these fat cells are eliminated through your body. You can expect to see 20-25% fat reduction with each treatment.</p><p>Some patients start to see results as soon as 3-4 weeks after treatment. However, it takes up to 3 months to see full results.</p><p>I recommend having a consultation with expert to determine if you are a good candidate for treatment.
