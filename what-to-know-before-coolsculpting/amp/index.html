<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>If you are looking for a non invasive procedure then Coolsculpting is a good fit for you. Most patients see about a 20-25% reduction with one treatment. In our practice we recommend patients do 2 treatments so they will have a more dramatic result. An in depth consultation will give you a better idea of exactly how many you will need. (Jeffrey B. Wise, MD, FACS, Wayne Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting is designed to be placed on pinch able fat especially on the abdomen and each session results in 30% reduction of fat targeted. Liposuction can take out as much fat as the operator seems necessary. (Payman Danielpour, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Will frozen fat stay in abdomen after CoolSculpting?</h5><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4142" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>With a single CoolSculpting treatment, approximately 20-25% of the fat cells in the treated area will be destroyed by the cooling process. The destroyed fat cells are then taken up by cells in the body called macrophages and eliminated.</p><p>The destroyed fat does not remain in the abdomen or wherever the treated area was located. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Can CoolSculpting be done before partial hysterectomy?</h4><p>I would not see any problem with having a CoolSculpting treatment prior to a partial hysterectomy. I would recommend speaking with the surgeon who will be performing your surgery just to make sure he or she is aware. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In my opinion, If you are going to have CoolSculpting done, it would be better to do so before your surgery. It will take up to 12-16 weeks to see the results from a treatment.</p><p>One of the contraindications for CoolScuplting is the presence of an abdominal hernia, so if you have ever had abdominal surgery, let the practitioner doing the CoolSculpting know. (David A. Sieber, MD, San Francisco Physician)</p><h4>Having a hysterectomy is CoolSculpting possible months before?</h4><p>I see no reason for you to not proceed and have your CoolSculpting done now. As you know you will see the peak results in about 3 months well before hysterectomy.</p><p>This will have no effect on your intended procedure. On the flip side if you wait until after surgery you will need a minimum of 6 months post surgery before you can safely proceed with CoolSculpting.</p><p>In my experience with both of your intended procedures go forward without reservation. (Paul Pietro, MD, Greenville Physician)</p><p><i>Coolsculpting before hysterectomy</i></p><p>This should be fine. Coolsculpting deals with superficial, stubborn pockets of fat and shouldn’t interfere with your scheduled procedure. Coolsculpting works best in combination with radiofrequency treatments such as Thermage, Vanquish, Venus Legacy with Z wave/Cellutone. (Jason Emer, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Coolsculpting before surgery</h3><p>Unless you have an abdominal hernia, or some other contraindication to Coolsculpting, there is no foreseeable reason that you shouldn’t be able to have Coolsculpting prior to your surgery. Coolsculpting only effects the superficial fat and nothing else, so you shouldn’t be concerned that Coolsculpting would interfere with anything related to your surgery.</p><p>Speak with the surgeon who will be performing your hysterectomy to see if there is any reason he/she would recommend waiting but I see no problem. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Coolsculpting and Pacemakers</em></p><p>There is no reason you cannot do coolsculping if you have a packmaker as long as it is not in the area of treatment. (Jason Emer, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Foot Fracture and CoolSculpting; should I wait?</em></p><p>CoolSculpting is an elective procedure and although safe you have a bigger and more acute problem to attend to. It would be best to wait until your foot fracture is better healed and your mobility is not so limited before proceeding with this elective treatment. (Paul Pietro, MD, Greenville Physician)</p><p>There is no risk or contraindications to do Coolsculpting. Coolsculpting does not cause blood clots. (Drew Varano, MD, Washington DC Physician)</p><p>Just delay you treatment. It is can be rescheduled for you when you are more mobile. Best to recover from you fracture and be walking around normally. (Robert Whitfield, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Anlke Fracture and Coolsculpting</h5><p>As a certified Coolsculpting practitioner I see no contraindication to this. After the procedure you should be as mobile as you are now anyway and that is not an issue. (Steven Costalas, DO, Bryn Mawr Physician)</p><p><b>Can CoolSculpting be performed on more than one area at a time?</b></p><p>It is possible to perform CoolSculpting on more than one area at a time but it require the use of more than one CoolSculpting device. The more common way we treat multiple areas during the same visit is to attach the applicator to one area and when the treatment of this area is done we would then move the applicator to the next one. (Ted Brezel, MD, Long Island Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>CoolSculpting: Can it remove lipomas?</h4><p>CoolSculpting is able to achieve many things, but the removal of lipomas is not on the list. Lipomas are a different type of benign fibrous fatty deposits that would require a visit to your physician to examine and remove surgically.</p><p>CoolSculpting is designed to remove smooth bulges of subcutaneous fat, and is a noninvasive cosmetic procedure. (Edward Stokes, MD, West Hollywood Physician)</p><h3>Lipomas of the body</h3><p>CoolSculpting is not indicated for lipomas, and is not FDA approved for treatment of lipomas. I would not expect a major improvement with CS treatment. (Reza Momeni, MD FACS, Summit Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Unfortunately coolsculpting will not do much for lipomas since the fat in lipomas is too dense and enclosed. Surgical excision is the best way to approach this. (Ramandeep Sidhu, MD, Issaquah Vascular Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4148" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><b>Can I get CoolScukpting if I have metal implants?</b></p><p>Metal implants from a back fusion, knee replacement, etc., are not a contraindication to CoolSculpting. I’m sure you are trying to get yourself into your previous physical shape before having had your fusion.</p><p>CoolSculpting allows you to get there in a safe non-surgical way. (Oscar A. Aguirre, MD, FPMRS, FACOG, Denver Urogynecologist)</p><h5>Coolsculpting with metal implants</h5><p>There are no contraindications to having Coolsculpt in if you have metal implants due to previous surgery. What is more important is whether or not you are a good candidate for the procedure based on your physical exam and expectations. (Stacey Folk, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There should be no problem with Coolsculpt and any metal implants or fusions. (Sanjay Lalla, MD, FACS, West Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4149" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p><b>Can you freeze a tumor in your pancreas with CoolSculpting? </b></p><p>No. Cool Sculpting only effects the fat directly under the skin. It is not designed to treat tumors. (Karl Hekimian, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting is used to reduce superficial fat that is just below the skin. It will not reach into the abdominal cavity and would have no effect on the pancreas and not freeze any tumor in it. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting After Ultherapy</strong></p><p>CoolSculpting and Ultherapy are complementary procedures. CoolSculpting is best at reducing the fat under the skin and Ultherapy is best at tightening the skin. The best results will come from tight skin over a reduced fat pad.</p><p>What varies from person to person is, the relative importance of each issue (loose skin/extra fat) to their neck. Your provider should help you decide if one or both treatments will be necessary to get the results you want to achieve. (Jeff Birchall, MD, Carlsbad Physician)</p><p>Wait for several months to evaluate your ultherapy response prior to having CoolSculpting. There will be time to do CoolScultping or treat that area with Kybella. (Robert Whitfield, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Does CoolSculpting treat cellulite?</h3><p>Cellulite is seen when the fibrous connections from the deep tissue pull on the skin causing a dimpling. This is hard to treat and many people think that this is fat. CoolSculpting does in fact treat fat by cooling it to a point to trigger permanent cell death, however, it does not treat cellulite. (Patrick L. Basile, MD, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Coolsculpting and Diet</h3><p>Coolsculpting and exercise and diet go hand in hand. The more you maintain a healthy diet and exercise the better the overall results. You can definitely do Coolsculpting at any point along this treatment plan and utilize it as a “jump start” to your healthy self.</p><p>Please consult with an expert in Coolsculpting for the best cosmetic results. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p>Dieting before CoolSculpting can be beneficial. When you diet, your fat cells shrink. The smaller the cells, the more that can fit in the coolSculpting applicator. So you could have a stronger reaction. (Janet Allenby, DO, Delray Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>You most certainly can do Coolsculpting before a diet, during or after. Having a complete consult with assessment from a certified practice can answer what your ideal treatment plan would be. We always encourage all patients to think of Coolsculpting as a ‘jump-start’ to getting the body you want.</p><p>We hope it will motivate you to keep making lifestyle changes that include eating healthier, becoming more active and enjoying life to it’s fullest. Our patients that are very active and losing weight have wonderful results due to the increased metabolism already working in their body.</p><p>They tend to see results even quicker. and continue on your journey to getting a better, healthier you! (Jennifer Cova, DO, Dayton Physician)</p><p>For best results, it is recommended to be at your ideal or stable weight before getting a sculpting liposuction procedure.(Jason Emer, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Coolsculpting and birth control tablets</em></p><p>There is no evidence that coolsculpting causes blood clots. There is always a risk of blood clots on birth control tablets. If that is a concern you need to discuss with your provider. (Sachit Shah, MD, Surrey Physician)</p><p>There is no problem doing Coolsculpting when taking birth control pills. Oral contraceptives certainly increase your risk of a blood clot in general and you should discuss options with your OB GYN if you have concerns. (Stacey Folk, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting treatments will not cause blood clots, so it would be fine to have a CoolSculpting procedure done while taking Yaz birth control. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting in a non-invasive treatment that reduces fat and helps contour the body. It is more of a body contouring treatment and not for weight loss. If you are over weight it would not be the best treatment for you.</p><p>I would recommend losing most of the weight first.
