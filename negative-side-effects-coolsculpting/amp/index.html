<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><b>CoolSculpting is a very well-tolerated procedure with few negative side effects</b></p><p>CoolSculpting is a very well-tolerated procedure. There is a tiny bit of discomfort but most individuals do not describe it as painful.</p><p>With the new CoolAdvantage applicators it’s even less uncomfortable than the it was with the original standard handpieces.</p><p>A bit of numbness and tingling for 4 weeks after the procedure is common. Permanent nerve damage has not been reported. Bruising with the original handpieces was uncommon. With the new CoolAdvantage applicators the risk of bruising is even less than it was before.</p><p>All in all CoolSculpting is a very well-tolerated procedure which yields excellent results in most individuals.

</div><h3>Very Little Pain or Risks</h3><p>There is very little risk to having CoolSculpting. That’s not to say there aren’t adverse effects or negative side effects. During the procedure you may experience some pain and discomfort. Most people tolerate it fine.</p><p>Most of the pain comes from the vacuum of the hand piece. There’s a strong tugging and pulling sensation when the hand piece goes on. When the cold temperature starts, you can get a searing discomfort.</p><p>That will go away after a few minutes as the skin goes numb. After the procedure, you will experience discomfort, as your treatment specialist massages the treated area. This can sometimes be uncomfortable, but generally is not painful.</p><p>After your treatment, you may experience discomfort or pain. Everyone experiences a different level of discomfort. Most people tolerate it fine. A few people will have to take an over the counter medication to manage the discomfort.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_463" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>A smaller group will require a prescription pain medication. (Garry K. Kim, MD, Pasadena Internist)</p><h3>What to Expect from a Coolsculpting Treatment</h3><p>What really impressed me as a physician is the incredible safety profile of the Coolsculpting technology by Zeltiq. There is no risk of damage to the nerves, skin, muscle or any of the surrounding tissues.</p><p>Think about putting water into a fridge- it cools, but doesn’t change state. If you put butter in the fridge- it hardens. Its not a perfect metaphor, but it helps to think of butter when we look at how Coolsculpting specifically targets the lipid cells in cryolipolysis.</p><p>As for the temperature, there are sensors on the inside of the applicators that freeze the tissue to specific degrees that start the cell death process. Most people feel a cool tingling sensation at first, and then go numb after about 6-7 minutes.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_464" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-5c2b43db30d37388c501e254aa351542">

</div><p>There is some mild discomfort during the two-minute manual massage post-treatment, but this does increase the efficacy by about 70%!</p><p>As for pain, everyone handles the procedure differently, but most go about their normal daily routine immediately afterwards.</p><p>You may experiences so bloating, swelling, numbness, or tingling, but all of these subside in a few days to weeks. Ibuprofen is generally recommended to manage any discomfort, or a Benadryl to help you sleep.</p><p>In 2011 Coolsculpting was approved in 46 countries, and now that number is 70+. This is an incredibly safe, effective procedure provided worldwide. (Vincent Marino, MD, Scottsdale Physician)</p><p><em>After Affects of CoolSculpting</em></p><p>Depending on which provider you visit for your CoolSculpting needs, can change your after affects. With the new CoolAdvantage the treatment time has been cut in half along with the discomfort of the treatment. The reduction in suction with the new CoolAdvantage has presented less after affects of bruising, swelling and pain.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_465" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-83e6c35ef7b5f8984a37bb8ce108c0bb">

</div><p>The suction level with be the same with every CoolAdvantage. CoolSculpting has been FDA approved for many years. (Gideon Kwok, DO, Rancho Cucamonga Physician)</p><h3>Zeltiq Coolsculpting Risks and Side Effects</h3><p>Nowadays with the new applicators we are detecting very little bruising and pain. Most patients complain of some numbness during the first 5 minutes of treatment, then it smooth out. Also, some patients have some pain in the treated area which resolves after 4-5 days.</p><p>CoolSculpting does not cause nerve damage. However, it varies from patient to patient as it is the individual’s characteristics that make them more sensitive to the procedure. However, having mild bruising and soreness is common. (Hardik Soni, MD (not currently practicing), Summit Emergency Medicine Physician)</p><h3>What does CoolSculpting Feel Like?</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_466" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Once the CoolSculpting applicator is applied to the area of treatment the patient will initially experience a tight pulling, pinching, tugging, and cooling sensation. After a few moments the sensation will subside and the patient will be able to take a nap, watch tv, read a book, eat lunch, or relax.</p><p>Following the procedure, it is possible the patient might experience slight bruising, sensitivity to the treated area, numbness, redness, and swelling. Not every patient experiences these side effects and the side effects are only temporary. (Mark Pinsky, MD, Palm Beach Gardens Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Coolsculpting side effects</em></p><p>Pain is minimal with Coolsculpting. The abdominal area can be associated with some pain, but lidocaine patches are great for alleviating this discomfort. Bruising can last 1-2 weeks, and burning is very minimal. I know… I did it to myself! (Jeffrey E. Schreiber, MD, FACS, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_467" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><i>CoolSculpting is safe but all treatments have some risk</i></p><p>The CoolSculpting fat reduction device by Zeltiq has been on the market now for a couple of years. The FDA cleared the device in Sep. of 2010. Some side effects include but are not limitied to: bruising, which can occur from the suction, like a hickey it goes away by itself in one to three weeks usually.</p><p>Some skin sensitivity or numbness can occur and also normally resolve on its own in several weeks to a coupe of months. There usually is slight swelling. Very rarely is there exquisite pain for a few weeks after that can be controlled with medication usually.</p><p>There is no guarantee of success but the average patient loses 20% of fat volume seen in four months after the treatment. A more thorough discussion can be rendered during your consultation with your physician as the above list is not complete. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_468" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><em>Coolsculpting negative side effects</em></p><p>Coolsculpting does not hurt, but can be uncomfortable for a few minutes until the cooling effect makes the area being treated numb. Bruising and pain post-treatment is rare, but can occur on occasion. Temporary nerve sensations have been reported, but there has not been anything permanent reported that I am aware of.</p><p>There is no real difference in sensation with the different applicators. Post-treatment care is simple – diet and exercise to maximize the effects of the procedure. I recently saw a patient who had Coolsculpting, and gained 30 pounds in the past 6 months and asked why the procedure didn’t work.</p><p>We cannot work miracles – you also have to participate in the care of your body. Complications are rare – bruising and a temporary numbing at the treatment site are the most common things we hear. (Michael Gold, MD, Nashville Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Zeltiq works well for fat reduction</h4><p>Zeltiq has some minor risks which include bruising, temporary numbness, tenderness and swelling. All are temporary. Zeltiq works very well. The new larger hand piece makes treatments of the abdomen quicker, in half the time.</p><p>Side effects are similar for all size hand pieces. (Lorrie Klein, MD, Laguna Niguel Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting Side Effects</i></p><p>The initial draw into the Zeltiq cup can feel a little uncomfortable, but goes away within 2-3 minutes, so the actual procedure does not hurt. After the procedure one can have a numbness or tingling in the treated area that typically last 2-3 weeks, rarely does anyone experience pain, and if so, it resolves on its own.</p><p>The greater the suction during the procedure, the greater likelihood one may experience a bruise. (Sabrina Fabi, MD, San Diego Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>CoolSculpting is a very safe procedure, with minimal temporary side effects.</h4><p>CoolSculpting has proven to be a very effective and safe procedure for non invasive fat removal. Only minor pain and bruising lasting several days may be seen some times after treatment.</p><p>Occasionally, some patients may develop more significant tenderness lasting for a few days, particularly if a large abdomen is treated with the 8.0 applicator. A minority of patients may have local numbness in the area treated for one to four weeks, but always resolves.</p><p>Over 100,000 treatments have been done in 30 countries to this date, and no scarring, pigment changes or permanent side effects have developed.
