<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><strong>Is CoolSculpting for Morbidly Obese patients</strong></p><p>CoolSculpting is not a weight loss treatment. It is a body sculpting treatment for exercise or diet resistant bulges.</p><p>The ideal candidate is the one who is close (within 10-15 pounds) of their ideal weight. (Ted Brezel, MD, Long Island Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cool sculpting if Overweight?</h3><p>No, I would not recommend cool sculpting to treat patients who are overweight.</p><p>As with any “body contouring” procedure, surgical or nonsurgical, it is best to have these procedures done when patients have achieved a long-term stable weight.</p><p>Cool sculpting, like liposuction surgery, is indicated for patients with diet and exercise resistant adipose tissue (with acceptable overlying skin elasticity attributes).</p><p>Generally speaking, patients who are overweight are better off seeking consultation with medical practitioners expert in weight loss, personal trainers, nutritionists etc. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>CoolSculpting won’t translate to weight loss</h3><p>CoolSculpting isn’t a weight loss program and won’t deliver any weight loss.</p><ol>
<li>Fat is very light and even when we do liposuction we end up with minimal, if any, weight loss.</li>
<li>It won’t result in any weight loss</li>
<li>The fat that is lost is excreted from the body</li>
<li>Fat cells won’t increase later so that part is good! (Joel Schlessinger, MD, Omaha Dermatologic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><h4>CoolScupting for overweight or morbidly obese people</h4><p>It is not that obese people cannot have CoolScupting procedure, but it is a reality is that in good conscience, the cost of getting enough of a noticeable result would be so prohibitive, that most physicians do not feel it is appropriate to recommend such a procedure to someone that is obese and to give them hope that with a a reasonable number of procedures they will achieve a reasonable result.</p><p>Having said that, if money is no object, use certainly can consider CoolScupting even if you are obese or overweight. The result will not be overt, so if you think even a mild subtle improvement would make a happy, and the money does not hurt your pocket book, you can certainly try it.</p><p>In reality, I would think most patients would be rather unhappy with the results that would obtain if they are morbidly obese or overweight. (Reza Momeni, MD FACS, Summit Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>CS can be done in overweight persons</h5><p>Persons at any weight may be a candidate for sculpting with CS. It is estimated that 20-25% of the upper fat layer is frozen with each cycle, and so, if there is significant thickness to the subcutaneous fat layer, at least two treatments in the same area will be required–this increases cost, and time to achieve the desired look.</p><p>In this scenario, liposuction will permit more fat removal in a single surgery with quicker results, and may actually be less expensive with the main tradeoffs being the need for anesthesia, small incisions, compression garment wear and a little time off work.</p><p>Another scenario, some overweight individuals have significant fat intra-abdominally, fat between tissue planes throughout the body, weak abdominal muscles permitting protrusion, etc. that is not accessible with CS and so no change will occur. Be sure to see a Coolsculpting University certified specialist in a plastic surgeon’s for an accurate assessment, and contrast with liposuction pros & cons. (Vaishali B. Doolabh, MD, FACS, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>You should be at your optimum weight for Zeltiq</em></p><p>Zeltiq is great but it is NOT meant as a weight loss device. It is best used on a single bulge when you are at your ideal weight. I always tell patients it is best to eat right, diet, and exercise, and get Zeltiq for those problem areas that do not get better after doing all of that. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h3>Zeltiq after optimal weight is obtained</h3><p>It is highly recommended that you reach your goal weight before performing any cosmetic sculpting treatments. It is adviseable to loose weight before treatment. (Ariel Ostad, MD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>Does CoolSculpting cause existing fat cells to multiply or increase?</h5><p>A single CoolSculpting procedure will normally cause destruction of about 20-25% of the fat cells in the treated area. The procedure will not cause other fat cells to multiply or increase in size. If a patient gains weight after CoolSculpting, it is possible to gain fat in the treated area as well as other parts of the body and face, as the existing fat cells can enlarge. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Every patient will be evaluated to make sure there are no contraindications. A physical assessment will be needed to see if you are a good candidate as well. If you are generally healthy and have no issues then yes it is possible to have CoolSculpting.</p><p>If you have blood clotting issues or nerve disorders, this may not be the treatment for you. It’s best to schedule an in-person consultation to get a better idea of what to expect from the treatment. (Robert G. Aycock, MD, FACS, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Can CoolSculpting fat reduction be more than 20-25% from one treatment?</h4><p>A single treatment of CoolSculpting to an area will normally cause a decrease in about 20-25% of the fat cells in the treated area. Normally, there would not be more reduction than this with just one treatment.</p><p>The 20-25% reduction may appear differently in treated patients however. The amount of fat prior to treatment can vary and this can influence the result. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Fat Reduction with Coolsculpting</h5><p>The average fat reduction is approximately 20-25%. However, can some patients respond a little higher, yes. Can some patients also have a less than 20-25% response, of course. The treatment really aims to provide that 20-25% range.</p><p>It also depends on how well of a candidate you are for the procedure. I would recommend consulting with a board certified Dermatologist or Plastic Surgeon who has experience with consulting and performing the procedure to really determine if you are a candidate for the procedure, as well as explaining your personal expectations. (David Goldberg, MD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Is CoolSculpting good for plus size?</h3><p>CoolSculpting is really designed to treat isolated areas of fat in people who are at or near their ideal body weight. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4130" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Unfortunately, CoolSculpting is not a weight loss procedure, it is more for sculpting and getting rid of small pockets of fat that don’t respond to diet and exercise. The treated area is placed between two cooling plates and is about the size of a cube of butter.</p><p>20% to 25% of the treated area is what will be reduced. (Miguel Delgado, MD, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>How many cycles can be done at once? </em></p><p>There is no limit as to how many treaments can be done in one day. It is based on preference and can be spread over a few appointments as it is sometimes easier and more comfortable for the patient.</p><p>If you are unsure as to which treatment to go with, try asking each for an explanation behind their treatment plans. A third opinion may help you feel less confused as well. (Martin Jugenburg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>How many cycles of CoolSculpting is too much at one time?</h5><p>There is really no maximum number of CoolSculpting cycles that can be done at one treatment session. The treatment plan may be different for different physicians however and can be tailored to the patient’s time schedule as well.</p><p>Doing a large number of cycles at the same session will prolong the treatment time and may not be desirable for some people. Some patients prefer splitting sessions up. I would not say that there is not an increased incidence of nerve pain when more cycles are done on the abdomen at once. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Coolsculpting and abdominal strengh</b></p><p>Coolsculpting is an out patient procedure with no down time that over time will reduce fat content by 20 to 20% in the area that is treated. The result is permanent but takes up to 3 months of maximum result.</p><p>It has no effect on any tissue other then the subcutaneous fat that is targeted. (Shahriar Mabourakh, MD, FACS, Sacramento Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Lower abdomen coolsculpting</h4><p>I am unfamiliar with coolsculpting leading to decrease muscle strength. Coolsculpting doesn’t act on the muscle layer. It is used to removed fat cells in the subcutaneous layer of the skin. There are no restrictions post treatment.</p><p>However, some patients do experience some swelling, tenderness or slight bruising. These are temporary. (Renee Burke, MD, Barrington Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Core Strength after CoolSculpting</em></p><p>CoolSculpting is non invasive and does not affect skin, tissue, or muscles with proper treatment. CoolSculpting is used to target and eliminate stubborn fat pockets and should not affect muscle strength. Clients may experience a feeling similar to muscle soreness after treatment but muscles aren’t actually involved.</p><p>If you are able to participate in a yoga class prior to treatment you should be able to resume classes immediately following treatment. Please consult with a Certified CoolSculpting Provider in your area for additional information. (Jeffrey Hinton, MD, Johnson City OB-GYN)</p><p>Each CoolSculpting treatment kills about 20-25% of fat cells in the treatment area. Depending on what your goals are, you may need multiple treatment sessions to get more desired results.</p><p>The CoolSculpting treatments will target the fat, but not the skin. If you are looking for optimal results, you may want to consider an abdominoplasty and weight loss. Make sure to speak with a board certified plastic surgeon to consider all of your options and to get an in-person evaluation. (Jeffrey M. Hartog, DMD, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
