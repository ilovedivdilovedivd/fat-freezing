<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Coolsculpting is an effective FDA non invasive treatment for excess fat. I have seen some impressive results with a series of 2-3 treatments.</p><p>However, the results do vary from patient to patient. Remember, cool sculpting requires no surgery and it will generally yield at least 10-20% improvement each treatment. It will take up to 3 month to appreciate your final results after each treatment.</p><p>However, you must understand that cool sculpting is NOT liposuction. Liposuction is a surgical procedure and will yield more definitive results.</p><p>Please visit with a board certified PS to learn more about your options. (C. Bob Basu, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The most important part of the coolsculpting process is the careful acessment of each individuals body type. Most abdominal areas are done with the curved applicators and it is likely that further areas may be done on you for final results. (Leslie Kardos, MD, FACOG, San Francisco OB-GYN)</p><p><strong>Is crooked CoolSculpting placement cause for concern?</strong></p><p>Normally, the flat applicator is used on the outer thighs, where the suction does not draw in a significant amount of tissue.</p><p>Usually on the abdomen, there is enough tissue that can be drawn in to use the suction applicator, which may give you a better result.</p><p>The CoolSculpting procedure will only affect the fat and not other tissue, so as long as the entire area of fat you wanted treated was included in the placement, it should not cause any problem.</p><p>If the applicator missed any of the fat on one side but not the other, then there could be some asymmetry. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Crooked CoolSculpting Application</em></p><p>Crooked abs are not very likely to result from your treatment, but you will need to wait at least 90 days before you can know for sure. If you do see an asymmetry, return to the clinic for a dialogue on options for correction. The applicators using suction will usually give a better result in this area if the fat is pinchable. (Kerry M. Shafran, MD, Charlotte Dermatologist)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4255" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><i>CoolSculpting vs. Liposuction on Thin Patients</i></p><p>If you have pinchable areas of subcutaneous fat, you may benefit from CoolSculpting. We have also had good results on carefully selected thin patients with use of the CoolSmooth applicator which does not depend on sucking the tissue into the applicator.</p><p>Liposuction can achieve results in cases where CoolSculpting isn’t a good option, but with liposuction on thin patients it is also challenging to achieve good results. I’d suggest a consultation with a surgeon who offers both treatments. (Roby F. Hayes, MD, Portland Physician)</p><p><em>Coolsulpting vs liposuction</em></p><p>Coolsculpting is indicated in those instances where the is a pocket of fat that can be pinched. It will not tighten lax skin. It would be important for you to be evaluated by an experienced practioner to see what would be the best treatment for you. (Jean M. Casello, MD, Northborough Physician)</p><p><strong>Lipo or CS</strong></p><p>It would be necessary to examine in person. While both treatments have overlapping uses in some patients, liposuction will give quicker results of a generally greater magnitude and permits better sculpting of the area. You should seek consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon who can counsel you about the best option. (Jeffrey D. Wagner, MD, Indianapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>CoolSculpting before Surgery</h5><p>It is safe to have a CoolSculpting treatment before surgery. However, I recommend scheduling your treatment at least 30 days before your surgery. Since you will have some downtime after your surgery, it may affect your full desired results with CoolSculpting.</p><p>If you are unable to schedule at least 30 days in between, then I would recommend scheduling your CoolSculpting treatment 30 days after your surgery. (Patrick L. Basile, MD, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4257" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h5>CoolSculpting before breast lift and augmentation</h5><p>In my opinion, it would be fine to have CoolSculpting performed on your abdomen and back a month before a breast lift and augmentation. I would recommend discussing this with your particular surgeon though, as your surgeon may feel differently. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting for saddle bags </em></p><p>There is a new applicator that can treat the outer thighs (saddle bags) with CoolSculpting. You would need to be examined to determine if you might be a good candidate for the procedure. The amount of fat reduction can vary, so it is impossible to tell you how many inches you might lose with the treatment. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting induces programmed cell death by selectively freezing fat cells. There is now an applicator designed for saddle bags. You should have your thighs evaluated to see if you are a candidate for this procedure. (Suzanne Kim Doud Galli, MD, PhD, FACS, Washington Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>For the right candidates the new CoolSculpting CoolSmooth applicator is a very effective treatment for the saddle bag area. You should see an experienced CoolSculpting provider in your area for an in-person consultation. They will be able to determine if you are a suitable candidate and how many treatments you will need to achieve an optimal result. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><p>I do thousands of Coolsculpting procedures over the years and have not seen the rippling that is associated with liposuction. Coolsculpting is the best non-surgical procedure for removing a bulge in a given area. You can’t overdue Coolsculpting if it is done properly. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p>In my experience with CoolSculpting, I have not seen patients develop lumps or rippling after treatment. I have found that most patients need between 1-3 sessions to obtain the desired result, so it would not be unusual to have a second treatment to the abdomen. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Can CoolSculpting be done at different temperatures?</b></p><p>The temperature setting on a CoolSculpting device is not adjustable, so every doctor would use the same temperature setting. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting is a great procedure and works really effectively. There is only a single temperature setting is assigned to the machine and it should not be adjusted. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p>No, doctors can not adjust the temperature of the cool sculpting treatment. The temperature is programmed into all the machines. (Janet Allenby, DO, Delray Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Coolsculpting post total hysterectomy due to ovarian cancer</i></p><p>While coolsculpting can be performed as long as it is not over recent surgical scars (within 6 months). Consult with a board certified physician to ensure that coolsculpting is the best option for you. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Is it advisable to use ice pack belt after CoolSculpting?</b></p><p>I would not recommend using an ice pack belt after a CoolSculpting treatment. The additional cooling could potentially harm the skin and I am not aware of any studies showing that an ice pack belt positively enhances results.</p><p>Multiple CoolSculpting sessions can enhance results, so I would recommend waiting 12 weeks after your first session and if you would then like improved results, a second treatment could be done. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Ice packs post Coolsculpting</i></p><p>Ice pack belts are not recommended post Coolsculpting. Coolsculpting is a safe, controlled method of freezing and permanently killing fat cells while keeping the surrounding tissue and structures from harm. An ice belt does not have the ability to cause apoptosis in fat cells and more importantly, it can cause harm to your skin in the form of freezer burn.</p><p>One of the best things about Coolsculpting is that post treatment there is nothing you need to do except maintain your lifestyle. Using gimmicks like ice belts are both unnecessary and unsafe. (Marcia Fleming, MD, Vancouver Physician)</p></div>
