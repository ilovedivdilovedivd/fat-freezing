<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>‚Äì I‚Äôm on day 9 of the large applicator on my lower ab. Cramps, nerves firing, can‚Äôt stay still. Swollen but not too bad. It‚Äôs just the shooting pain! Won‚Äôt do this again.</p><p>‚Äì I had my stomach in January and I still have moderate pain. The nurse, after five month check, told me yes it is normal. Full recovery takes a year. Never again!</p><p>‚Äì Now on day 16. I purchased a compression belt on day 11 and it totally helped. I still get quick nerve twinges every once in a while but totally bearable. I‚Äôm down half a pound but still feel bloated.</p><p>‚Äì the pain gets better.. after 10 days for me, I started to feel the nerve pain less.. I did not take any pain medication. at all. not even motrin. none of that will work, because its nerve pain. I used a compression garment‚Ä¶ I had my procedure done on june 24, I fell great. I notice the results. I did two large applicators on my lower abdomen. worse pain ever though‚Ä¶ hang in there girl.. it gets better üôÇ<br>
‚Äì  I had my lower abdomen done 6 days ago. First of all, it was very painful the entire 60 minutes! The pain never went away as they said it would‚Ä¶ At the end I almost passed out from the experience. It was so bad, I would never have done it had I known. Now I‚Äôve been in bad pain over the past few days and they just prescribed Vicodin. Yet, they say it‚Äôs ‚Äúunusual‚Äù to have such pain. But as I read these blogs, I am not that unusual! Why are they glossing over it? Why don‚Äôt they give some type of pain block before? And the FDA should make the marketing materials be more realistic!</p><p>‚Äì  I just have to comment because I too am in severe pain like so many of you , on day 7 now my upper abs used cool fit . Same thing happened on lower an with cool max 3-5 day after treatment started feeling the intense nerve pain for me started to get better on day 8 I‚Äôm hoping the same for this round. I am a medical esthetician And work with a plastic surgeons practice this is considered late onset pain it effects about10% of patients and usually a smaller frame with the larger piece. For me the only thing that makes it bare able is ice pacs with compression garment. I will say it is up to the practice to inform the patient about all side effects and knowing the possibility of these side effects makes it less scary if it happens to you. My clients are always informed of these issues I am walking example hit me twice it sucks but you do get through it. I won‚Äôt be doing it again as far as the results go I have not had one dissatisfied patient and I deffenatly got results from treatment 1. The practice needs to make sure you are a good candidate that is key.<br>
‚Äì  That was my experience with large applicator on lower abs. I am very petite and device sucked in whole belly. I was swollen for 5 weeks and in pain and discomfort whole time and doctor said it was me. I did see result after 8 weeks when dust settled and a kicked up exercise routine produced a noticable result. I cancelled the second appointment too much pain and not enough gain but I have to say if I did the second round I probably would have gotten the result I wanted and they promised. Still I did see result but after 5 months still haven‚Äôt gone back for second application pain does go away but the memory of it still lingers after 5 months!!</p><p>‚Äì I had the procedure done on my stomach (4 small devices) $2,200 at a so called doctors office on 8/19/17, but never actually saw a doctor and five days out I am miserable; Swollen, spiking pain hurts to bend over . I called the office and spoke to the receptionist who swears I‚Äôm making up the discomfort in my mind and her only concern was when am I going to schedule my next appt that thank God I did not pay for it in advance they way she had pressed me to do. I can deal with the pain, but it would have been nice to be warned. It‚Äôs all about the money ‚Äì Not even a follow-up call to see how I was feeling ‚Äì for Shame on them. Now to deal with the pain and wait for the results. Might consider doing my back if the results are worth the pain, but I doubt that I will. Thank you all the Ice Packs are really helping.<br>
‚Äì I also had severe pain. I also called the office where I had the procedure done and spoke with the receptionist, telling him I was in agony. He told me he would give the doctor the message immediately. She never called me back. To not receive a follow up phone call after a procedure is bad enough, but to not get a call back when you are experiencing a complication is inexcusable. I also contacted the company via their website. I received an email after some time went by basically saying too bad this happened, we are now closing the case since it has been over 30 days, I responded that it had not been 30 days yet and received essentially the same response, Immediately after the procedure, the medical assistant told me I might have ‚Äúlate onset‚Äù pain, that most people did. She said they are supposed to fill out a form for complications for the FDA when when side effects such as severe pain occur but they never do because it happens to everybody and would be too much paperwork. My take on it is that the offices are in it for the money and they and the company are engaged in actively covering up complications so as to retain FDA approval.</p><p>‚Äì Sixth day of pain and sleepless nights. Shame on these doctors for not telling us about these nerve pains. They should have least prescribed something for the pain, that actually works. A nerve blocker should be required as a part of this procedure. This is awful. Lord have mercy on me. I too feel like suing them for their gross negligence in post treatment care and lack of transparency up front as it relates to the extreme nerve pain. What is making me so angry is I told them that I would be traveling for work and personal reasons over the next three weeks, and they did not recommend I wait. Imagine trying to do a presentation to hundreds of people with your stomach literally feeling like you have 3rd degree burns and being stabbed by needles at the same time. The standard response to those of us suffering is this is a rare occurrence. I later found out that every one experiencing this pain is told this. I have yet to hear from anyone who had a painless experience with the abdominal treatment.<br>
‚Äì Since it has now been over 5 months since I had the procedure, and the tremendous nerve pain so many of you have endured, I wanted to let you know if the results were worth it. Definitely NOT. In fact, although I was told in the initial consultation that I was an excellent candidate, and then told in the first follow-up that ‚Äúmost people who experience the nerve pain have the biggest change because the pain is a sign of the inflammatory response that means the fat cells were effected‚Äù, I can see absolutely NO reduction. To her credit, my doctor agreed with my evaluation and gave me 100% of the fee back. So, it only cost me three weeks of intense pain. Hard to believe this procedure was FDA approved!!</p><p>‚Äì I had coolsculpting on my lower abdomen exactly a week ago and I‚Äôm having the worst pain of my life. It‚Äôs even worse than my labor pains with my 2 children which is a constant stabbing pain in varying degrees and location. It feels as though I‚Äôm being stabbed with a knife and there‚Äôs shooting and burning pain. I hope I didn‚Äôt get permanent nerve damage. My MD prescribed Gabapentin which is not helping at all. I feel so drugged but the pain is excruciating and debilitating. I can‚Äôt even carry or hug my 2 small children. I would never do this again even if it was for free. Can anyone please tell me if this is permanent or temporary.</p><p>‚Äì I had horrible shooting burning pain starting around day 4. On day 15 it began to subside, and by day 21 it was down to intermittent achiness. I took Alleve and Tylenol; one night when I woke up in unbearable pain, I took a prescription pain reliever, but nothing really touched it. An ice pack was the most help. I hear that gabapentin is effective but it might take a few days to kick in. I hope you are feeling better soon.</p><p>‚Äì My experience is the pain is temporary. I had Coolsculpting about 4 months ago and did experience some pain as you describe; but I got a compression garment a few days later and it helped a lot. I just had another treatment yesterday to take care of a bit more pooch on my stomach, and I put on the garment before I even left the doctor‚Äôs office. I have had NO pain thus far. Give it a try. (I recommend the Maidenform Flexees Seamless Shapewear, the High Waist ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs very soft yet firm and comfortable).</p><p>‚Äì My bad stabbing burning pain was gone by day 14. After that I was left with internal itching and external numbness. I am 9 weeks out now, and I can tell a difference in my lower belly. Now I‚Äôm trying to decide if I want to do it again. When I told the girls at the Dr‚Äôs office about my intense pain they claimed it might not happen again. Yeah right. Still haven‚Äôt decided if the pain is worth 20% loss. </p><p>‚Äì For everyone suffering with pain from Coolsculpting of the abs, try a compression garment. And if you are planning on having the procedure‚Ä¶get a compression garment beforehand and put it on before you even leave the dr. office after the treatment. I had my original treatment in early May and just had a second round yesterday to take care of a bit more fat on my stomach. Having done it both ways (first time, I didn‚Äôt get the garment until a few days later), the garment is helping IMMENSELY. I am almost pain free. I‚Äôm using the Maidenform Flexees Women‚Äôs Shapewear Seamless Hi-Waist Brief that I bought from Amazon. It covers your tummy from your bottom to right below your boobs. It‚Äôs strong, fits tightly, yet is really comfortable and the fabric is really soft. I even wore it to bed last night and slept like a baby.</p><p>‚Äì  I was awake all night last night (5 days post sculpt) in horrible burning, stabbing shooting pain. Ended up using an ice pack and Percocet. I had mastopexy in June, and the recovery was less painful than this! My friend had cool sculpt done several months ago, and she didn‚Äôt have this type of pain. I feel like I had actual liposuction and not a non-invasive, simple procedure.</p><p>‚Äì I had coolsculpting done 45 days ago on my thigh. The elimination of fat caused my ileum (small intestine) to become inflamed and resulted in fatty stools. I went in for colonoscopy and stool tests to find out all this. This procedure has caused major health scare. Fat is dumped and overloads your system. Doctors said symptoms were similar to Crohn‚Äôs disease which is autoimmune sickness. Coolsculpting basically induces a form of inflammation and dumps fat through stool and urine. I do not recommend the journey I have made to anyone.</p><p>‚Äì I‚Äôm reading all these complaints about pain, but I‚Äôm curious: are any of you (or all of you) drinking lots of water and wearing a compression garment? I had five zones treated in one day and feel nothing more than a little sensitivity‚ÄìI‚Äôm four days out. My Dr. told me to drink plenty of water because dehydration would have a negative effect on my ‚Äúrecovery.‚Äù The compression garment DOES hurt somewhat to put it on, but I promise once you‚Äôre in it, you will feel so much better. The tightness holds everything together and really relieves most tenderness.</p><p>‚Äì I had the procedure done 11 days ago and I am still experiencing terrible pain! Nothing helps but ice packs‚Ä¶unfortunately, I cannot have ice packs on all day long since. I would not recommend this procedure to my worst enemy!</p><p>‚Äì After drinking Rooibos Tea, Milk Thisle Tea, and Tiger Balm patches‚Ä¶I have no more pain. Just slight swelling‚Ä¶although, I was prescribed ‚Äòvicodin‚Äô‚Ä¶took 1 pill on the 9th day, and no more after then. (I just prefer herbal remedies..heals a lot faster) . I can honestly say I have no pain‚Ä¶and it will be 14 days this Friday. I just want effective results for the unknown discomfort. Thank goodness for this forum as it is restoring my faith of a positive outcome.</p></div>
