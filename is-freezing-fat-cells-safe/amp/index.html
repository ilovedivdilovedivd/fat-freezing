</div>CoolSculpting works because fat cells freeze at higher temperatures than other tissues. The device operates at a temperature that is low enough to trigger the breakdown of fat cells — but not skin, muscle, and other cells.
<p>This is why it’s so important to visit a qualified practitioner who uses a genuine CoolSculpting device, rather than any other off-brand “fat freezing” machine. CoolSculpting has been thoroughly studied, and lumpy, uneven results are uncommon.</p><p>Keep in mind also that it’s not ideal for large-volume fat reduction. Instead, it’s meant for small areas of unwanted fat on people who are otherwise in good shape. (Mark E. Freeman, MD, Idaho Falls Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Long term effects of coolsculpting</h3><p>CoolSculpting is a very safe procedure with few long term effects. The main one would be paradoxical fat cell hyperplasia which is a rare complication that can lead to increase in fat. Also improper application can result in debts and lumpy appearance.</p><p>In our practice the ideal candidate is within 15 pounds of their ideal body weight. Someone who is obese is not a candidate for the CoolSculpting procedure. It is best to consult with an expert to determine if CoolSculpting is right for you. (Hardik Soni, MD (not currently practicing), Summit Emergency Medicine Physician)</p><h3>Safety & Long Term Effects of CoolSculpting</h3><p><strong>A. When it comes to reading reviews and comments about CoolSculpting online you should factor in a number of variables.</strong></p><p>1. Who is performing the treatment. Skill, experience, and esthetic eye all make a big difference. There is a lot more than just applying the applicator and letting it go to work. </p><p>There is a lot of treatment planning, mapping, and following results. Areas may need to be treated again.</p><p>2. There are counterfeit CoolSculpting machines sold and used by many of the practices offering CoolSculpting in the U.S. Why? Because it costs much less.</p><p>Results are unpredictable, inferior, and often times result in complications.</p><p><strong>B. How it works</strong></p><p>1. CoolSculpting freezes fat cells causing apoptosis, slow cell death. The fat leaks out of the cells and gets excreted from the body.</p><p>This effect is permanent. Studies have shown that this doesn’t damage surrounding non fat cells such as skin, muscle, and nerves.</p><p>2. <strong>Lumpiness</strong>: this is rarely seen when the procedure is performed properly. If gaps are left between the applicator placement, you could get an area that bulges.</p><p>Treating over that untreated area will leave a smooth result. The key is to have some overlap in the treatment areas to avoid this from happening.</p><p>C. Who is a better candidate, skinny or heavier people?</p><p>1. <strong>Heavier patients</strong>: Results are quite dramatic and can come close to liposuction results especially when second treatments are performed over the same area. You even get some skin tightening much like in our SmartLipo patients</p><p>2. <strong>Skinnier patients</strong>. We see great results. They typically have trouble areas they cant lose with exercise such as love handles in men. Losing those extra 3 to 5 pounds often creates a gaunt facial appearance- the face pays the price.</p><p>CoolSculpting can finish the job so that excessive weight loss and dieting is not required in fit people. (Ran Y. Rubinstein, MD, Manhattan Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Expectations of results following CoolSculpting, its safety and efficacy.</i></p><p>Specifically because the CoolSculpting procedure has been designed to safely deliver precisely controlled cooling to target the fat cells underneath the skin, the skin itself and surrounding tissue remains unaffected. The applicators which are applied to the area to be treated have sensors which can detect if the skin is getting too cold and will then shut the system down automatically which is a unique safety mechanism specific to CoolSculpting.</p><p>As fat freezes at a higher temperature to water, the procedure will kill the fat cells without damaging the skin. This procedure gives smooth and even results in the treated areas if performed by an expert.</p><p>An experienced CoolSculpting practitioner will assess the area or areas you want treated, explain the procedure and what to expect. They should also be able to talk through your expectations of the results you wish to achieve and explain how long it will take for you to notice an improvement (typically up to 2 months following treatment).</p><p>Whilst CoolSculpting is not a replacement for a healthy diet and exercise, if you are able to grab fat in areas such as the abdomen, thighs, flanks and under the chin, you are likely to be a suitable candidate for CoolSculpting.</p><p>You should discuss any concerns you have with your doctor or practitioner prior to treatment. (Tracy Mountford, MBBS, London Physician)</p><h3>Coolsculpting for stomach and love handles</h3><p>Coolsculpting treats selectively the fat cells. The effect of low temperatures on fat was discovered when kids came with dimples after sucking on popsicles. There was no damage to the surrounding structures. Treatment of the stomach and love handles is safe and very effective.</p><p>Those subjects who have less fat may require less applications, cycles or additional treatments. </p><p>People who have more fat and would like, more contouring may require additional treatments. The machine comes with several applicators which can adapt to different shapes and sizes.</p><p>For the treatment to be effective, the fat deposit has to be treated uniformly to a therapeutic temperature. </p><p>If we can achieve that with one application then you will not require additional treatments and you will have the same response as a thinner person.</p><p>The difference may just be in the number of cycles needed for one treatment. Many centers are now offering free consultations so may be you can take advantage of that and see if you are a candidate and find out more about number of cycles and treatments you will require for best results. (Anca Tchelebi-Moscatello, MD, Mount Kisco Hair Restoration Surgeon)</p><h4>Coolsculpting has been around for 6 years</h4><p>Coolsculpting works great to reduce the fat associated with localized fat bulges as seen on love handles and abdomen. The procedure is FDA approved for love handles and appears to be very safe. The procedure, however, has only been available prior to the FDA approval for the last 6- 7 years.</p><p>There are roughly 60-70,000 cases performed to date. (Steven Hacker, MD, West Palm Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>CoolSculpting long term effect – Its safe</h3><p>Coolsculpting is a safe procedure approved by the FDA. Coolsculpting uses a process called cryolipolysis which is based on scientific research showing that fat cells are more sensitive to the effects of freezing than the other adjacent tissues.</p><p>These fat cells are removed by the bodies own natural process. There are no foreign body introduced to the body. I actually had coolsculpting performed on myself. There are no long term negative effects of coolsculpting.</p><p>Make sure you are properly evaluated prior to your treatment. (Stanley Okoro, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Are there Long-term Effects from Cooslculpting?</strong></p><p>During the Coolsculpting procedure, there are protective barriers in between your skin and the cooling panels allowing for the skin to be protected. The temperature setting for the applicator allows only for fat cell death, therefore skin is left unharmed.</p><p>Coolsculpting is a very safe procedure. There are risks and side effect with any procedure, although there has not yet been a permanent side effect reported from Coolsculpting. If applicator placement is not accurate, Coolsculpting can leave an indentation or concavity in the tissue treated.</p><p>This is why it is important to have your Coolsculpting procedure done with an experienced provider.
