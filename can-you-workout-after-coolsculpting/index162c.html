(Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p><i>After Zeltiq Coolsculpting treatments swimming and exercising ok</i></p><p>There are no limitations after treatment with Zeltiq Coolsculpting except it would be wise to avoid sunbathing if you have a bruise on your abdomen.</p><p>You certainly could swim after wards and do your work outs as you mentioned.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1981" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I tell patients not to be alarmed if they have some swelling of the abdomen after wards. You could also expect intermittent cramping like sensations one or two days after the coolsculpting treatment to the abdomen and this can last 8 to 10 days.</p><p>It is more annoying than painful (Louise Ferland, MD, Richmond Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Activity level following coolsculpting</i></p><p>You may resume working out after Coolscultping and once you feel ready. I typically advise my patients they may resume non impact exercise immediately and impact exercising after 1 week. (Steven Hacker, MD, West Palm Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Safe to resume all daily activities immediately after CoolSculpting</strong></p><p>It is safe to resume all daily activities Immediately after CoolSculpting. However, if you had your abdomen treated, for example, you might be slightly tender in that area to do stretching abdominal excercises. All else should be fine. (Leyda Elizabeth Bowes, MD (not practicing), Miami Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1982" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><strong>Activity after CoolSculpting</strong></p><p>One of the best things about the CoolSculpting procedure is that there is “no down time” and so patients can get a treatment and go work out later that day if they want. I am sure you have been told that there may be bruising / swelling that may be seen if you are wearing a bikini.</p><p>Otherwise, you can do whatever you would like! (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>After having Zeltiq treatment on the lower abdomen you may experience some bruising, which, depending on your bathing suit, may not be the ideal for a day at the beach. Patients can experience some soreness and tingling after the procedure but most do not find that it limits their activities or ability to work out following treatment.</p><p>Regardless of potential soreness, it is in no way harmful for you to swim or exercise after treatment. Exercise and movement, which can increase circulation, may actually help the body to eliminate the treated fat cells more quickly and efficiently. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Physical Activity After Zeltiq</strong></p><p>We tell all our patients that they can resume normal activity immediately after a treatment. In fact, during our training session, one of the physicians went straight to a spin class after and a PA went to a bootcamp class! The only think you may notice is some mild soreness and tenderness but it certainly is not enough for you to cancel your workout routine. (Grace Liu, MD, Newport Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>There are no true contraindications to exercising after the procedure. However, the treated areas will be mild to moderately sore and there is usually a funny numb sensation. There may also be some light brusing.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1984" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It ultimately depends on your own pain tolerance. Most people will not feel like exercising for a few days. But you would do not harm by exercising immediately. (Narin (Joe) Apisarnthanarax, MD, Houston Dermatologist)</p><p><em>Recovery time after CoolSculpting and liposuction</em></p><p>There is normally no downtime after a CoolSculpting treatment and you could exercise immediately after the procedure if you desired. After liposuction, you would need to avoid strenuous activity at least for several weeks. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Coolsculpting vs Liposuction</h3><p>Coolsculpting and liposuction are both great options for fat removal. Coolsculpting is ideal for someone who works out regularly and eats healthy but just has some stubborn areas of fat on their body. The procedure is non-invasive, which means there are no needles and it can be done it just a few hours at an office setting.</p><p>Liposuction is much more invasive and usually requires the patient to be under general anesthesia. The results are much more dramatic and will be seen much faster than the results from coolsculpting. In terms of downtime after Coolsculpting, you can expect a few days of soreness and some minor bruising and swelling.</p><p>You can start working out again the next day if you’d like. Regarding your liposuction recovery, you will most likely be looking at 1-2 weeks of downtime and you want to wait at least a few weeks to a month before you start working out again. (Jeffrey Rockmore, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Some swelling and soreness in the area treated is expected and normal post Cool/Sculpting. The more areas treated the more swelling and soreness expected. Because CoolSculpting is non-invasive there are no restrictions to amount or type of exercise after the procedure.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1986" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Typically we find the limiting factor is the persons tolerance of these post treatment findings. So feel free to go about your normal routine regarding exercise to your tolerance. (Paul Pietro, MD, Greenville Physician)</p><p><i>After Coolsculpting, no restrictions</i></p><p>If you are up for it, the gym is fine. There are no restrictions on exercise or what type of workout you do. That’s part of the beauty of Coolsculpting. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>No Downtime with CoolSculpting</i></p><p>There are no restrictions on working out after CoolSculpting. You can go to the gym immediately following your treatment. There is no downtime. You do not need to avoid any exercises, just do what feels comfortable. You may be a little numb and tender following your CoolSculpting treatment. (Jeffrey M. Hartog, DMD, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Exercise after CoolSculpting</b></p><p>There are no restrictions after CoolSculpting and you can get back to the gym right away. I personally, played my hockey game the same night I had my treatment and had no problems. Some people have some “bruise like” discomfort afterwards and may want to avoid aggravating that, but as a rule you are good to go. (Jeff Birchall, MD, Carlsbad Physician)</p><p><em>No downtime / no exercise avoidance after coolsculpting</em></p><p>There is no true downtime or avoidance of exercise needed after coolsculpting. There can be some discomfort, tenderness, swelling or bruising that will make some exercises uncomfortable. But nothing need be avoided.</p><p>Some patients prefer wearing compression clothing for a few days after when running or doing other jostling exercises, but it is not necessary. (Kyle Coleman, MD, New Orleans Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Getting Back To The Gym After CoolSculpting</em></p><p>There is no downtime with the CoolSculpting procedure. You can resume all your regular activities immediately, including going to the gym. However, use your own judgement and if you experience any discomfort then don’t over do it. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><p>There is no downtime with CoolSculpting. You can go to the gym and resume normal activities when you are ready to do so. (Christine Sullivan, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Final results after CS generally take 3-4 months. However, you should start to feel a difference in the way your clothes fit after 3-4 weeks. Results certainly vary. CoolSculpting has no downtime, so you can exercise the same day as your treatment if you want. (Michael Kerin, MD, New Rochelle Physician)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1989" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-fb42a38c06cdbcf9cf17b525cc8a1ffc">

</div><p><em>No Limitations after Coolsculpting 🙂</em></p><p>You can exercise immediately after the procedure – there are no restrictions! If you feel sore, at all, then, you can take it easy until that resolves 🙂 Most start seeing subtle improvement within 1-2 months (especially if the Coolsculpting is combined with Zwave treatments, which speeds up the improvement.)</p><p>However, it will take likely 4 months or more to see optimal improvement. Sometimes, the improvement from the first treatment is so subtle it’s hard to notice the difference. It’s very unlikely to not notice the improvement with additional treatments, though :). (Lauren Chavez, MD, Albuquerque Physician)</p><p><b>Results after CoolSculpting</b></p><p>You will see your final result at about 4 months, although many patients can see a difference (and we see changes from the pre-treatment photos done in the office) as quickly as 6-8 weeks, with further improvement seen at the 4 month point.</p><p>If a patient wants a 2nd treatment in the same area, we will do it 2 months following the 1st session. The beauty of CoolSculpting is that there is no down-time and no limitations on activity post treatment.</p><p>I have actually have had patients who have been in the gym working out an hour after their treatment. (Mary Beth Mudd, MD, Columbus Physician)</p><p>It can take 3-4 months to see your results. Expect some soreness, bruising, and/or discomfort. You can exercise that same day if you wanted to. There are no restrictions when it comes to exercise.</p><p>You can start as soon as you feel up to it. (Robert G. Aycock, MD, FACS, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>How long to see CoolSculpting results?</i></p><p>It can take up to 12 weeks to see results from a CoolSculpting treatment. There is no recovery period needed after the treatment, so walking and exercise can be done anytime after the treatment is completed. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting results can take 3-4 months. You are able to exercise the same day of treatment if you want. Most don’t because the area is sensitive. Exercise can also aggravate swelling during the first few days. (Janet Allenby, DO, Delray Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting: How Long for Results to Appear?</em></p><p>CoolSculpting is a remarkable treatment that is noninvasive an will permanently remove 20-25% of the fat from any treated area. </p><p>Most areas will need to be treated twice in order to achieve optimal results. The results from CoolSculpting typically begin to show any where from one month to 90 days post treatment.</p><p>Best and final results generally are seen from 90 days up to six months post treatment. Regarding the return to normal everyday activities, most of our patients return to work and the gym same day. There are some, occasionally, who are more sensitive and need to wait a day or two.</p><p>But, for most, there is little to no downtime whatsoever.
