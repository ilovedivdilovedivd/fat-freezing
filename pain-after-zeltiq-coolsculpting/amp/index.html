<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The pain depends on the size of the applicator and type of tissue treated.</p><p>We have had very few patients with any sign pain after Coolsculpting, but in all those occured in patients who had the abdomen treated with the large applicator.</p><p>We attribute our success to the use of percussion devices that helps distribute the temperature gradient across the tissue and reduce the chance of tissue damage and nerve irritation. (Amir Moradi, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Cool sculpting is highly tolerable</i></p><p>Typically there is some mild discomfort, tenderness and swelling following cool sculpting procedure that is quite tolerable.</p><p>This is pretty consistent but can vary in intensity from patient to patient and likely reflects normal inter patient variability in pain tolerance as well as how much fat was treated.</p><p>This is tolerated very well in most patients with little effect on lifestyle or daily activities. There is a small number of patients (.04%) who experience more intense pain that is less tolerable. This is thought to be neurogenic in origin and is transient, often lasting less than a week.</p><p>If necessary can be treated until resolved. This is a relatively rare event, but can happen and is reassuring that it is short lived and with no long term consequences. (Andrea Willey, MD, Sacramento Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Only a very small percentage of patients experience extreme pain</h4><p>Everyone is different and everyone’s pain tolerance is different, however, it is important to know that only a very small percentage of patients experience extreme pain. In fact, we have treated a large number of patients over the last year and only 1 patient has experienced extreme pain, which also completely resolved after two weeks. (Renato Saltz, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Pain After CoolSculpting</i></p><p>Each patient is different, and therefore healing times and severity of side effects differs. For example, one patient might have a very high pain threshold whereas another patient could be very sensitive.</p><p>It all depends on the individual receiving the treatment.</p><p>Generally, patients do not experience severe pain after CoolSculpting. (Daniel Shapiro, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Pain Variation with CoolSculpting</h3><p>The first factor to consider is that every individual’s pain threshold is different. Unlike tumescent liposuction, CoolSculpting is a non-invasive treatment. It requires no incision and no intrusive vacuuming of the targeted fat. CoolSculpting works by using a two-paneled device that holds the targeted area and delivers cooling technology to freeze fat cells.</p><p>The fat cells die through apoptosis and are then disposed of by the body’s natural defenses. There is no anesthesia or pain medication needed with this procedure. The severe pain reported may be due to a low pain threshold and unfamiliarity with the cold temperature on the bare skin.</p><p>Rest assured that CoolSculpting will never drop to temperatures that cause frostbite. The technology simply targets fat cells while leaving all other skin, tissue and healthy cells undisturbed. (Daniel Behroozan, MD, FAAD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>Coolsculpting and Pain</h5><p>Coolsculpting is a painless procedure. The arms, abdomen, legs, flanks, and outer buttock areas only have minimal discomfort for the first few minutes until the applicator freezes the area after several minutes.</p><p>However, the abdominal area can be uncomfortable in some patients for a few days to weeks after the procedure. This discomfort feels much like doing a “hundred sit-ups”. In a rare subset of patients they may have pain in the abdominal area afterwards since the nerves were irritated and may require analgesics.</p><p>The most important thing is to consult a board certified dermatologist with a great deal of experience with coolsculpting for the best cosmetic results. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1352" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>Coolsculpting is a fairly pain free procedure. Patients that report a lot of discomfort after the procedure were likely treated with the larger head piece that treats the lower abdomen. The abdomen tends to be the most sensitive area to treat but also the most popular.</p><p>Areas like inner and outer thighs have very few complaints of pain. (Brian C. Reuben, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Cool sculpting and pain</strong></p><p>Pain during the procedure is very unusual. When the device is initially applied, some patients describe mild discomfort or pressure at about 4 minutes which usually subsides within one minute. Make sure to see a surgeon who is certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery for all your aesthetic concerns. (Richard Chaffoo, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Why Do Some Coolsculpting Patient Report Little Pain and Others Report Severe Pain?</strong></p><p>Coolsculpting is a fairly pain free procedure. Following the treatment most people continue with their normal daily routines. Over the course of a few days, some people feel mild discomfort similar to what you might feel after a workout.</p><p>Compression garments can help alleviate those aches. On occasion, significant pain has been reported in less than 4% of patients and can be mitigated with compression, ice and even a doctor prescribed medication in severe cases.</p><p>The patients who experience significant discomfort are usually the patients which had a treatment with a single large applicator on the lower abdomen area. The abdomen tends to be the most sensitive area to treat but also the most popular.</p><p>Areas like inner and outer thighs have very few complaints of pain. (Steven Gabel, MD, FACS, Portland Hair Restoration Surgeon)</p><p><em>Difference in Pain</em></p><p>It is common to experience a little discomfort during the initial application and especially if you were treated with the larger head piece. Once the precise cooling has been initiated the area will start to go numb within 7 to 10 minutes and the discomfort starts to dissipate.</p><p>The abdomen tends to be the most sensitive of all areas that we treat. (Sheila S. Nazarian, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Pain after Coolsculpting</h5><p>I do find with most procedures that there is a wide variety of discomfort. As a general rule, I have found the following:</p><ol>
<li>Abdominal treatments tend to have more discomfort than other body regions</li>
<li>Those with a greater degree of tissue pull into the applicator have greater discomfort</li>
</ol><p>The majority of patients return to their normal activities afterwards, and a minority may need some medication support to help with the discomfort.</p><p>I would make sure you do your treatments at a place with a lot of Coolsculpting experience and who can help manage the post-procedure concerns.
