<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h5>Does CoolSculpting Address Skin Laxity</h5><p>CoolSculpting is a non-invasive treatment used for fat reduction. It does not address skin laxity.</p><p>You are at risk of additional skin laxity, especially if it is already an issue. You can combine CoolSculpting with a non-invasive skin tightening treatment such as ThermiSmooth. (Shamim Shakibai, MD, Los Angeles Physician)</p><p><i>Coolsculpting will not increase skin laxity </i></p><p>An exciting discovery about coolsculpting is that not only will it not increase skin laxity, but it can also tighten the skin as the fat is reduced. Once the fat is reduced, you can achieve additional tightening noninvasively with ultherapy. (Heidi A. Waldorf, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h5>Coolsculpting Provides Improvement in Body Contour That lasts!</h5><p>Coolsculpting produces permanent reduction in fat. It does not tighten the skin. If you have skin laxity in the area treated, you will continue to have skin laxity following Coolsculpting. For skin tightening, a surgical lift or skin tightening technology, such as Ultherapy or Thermage is required. (Andrew T. Lyos, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>CoolSculpting Can’t Address Excess Skin</h3><p>CoolSculpting is inherently designed to destroy fat without having any effect on the layers of skin on top.</p><p>However, because CoolSculpting stimulates the body to gradually remove dying fat cells on its own, this gives your skin adequate time to adjust to the new contour of the treatment area.</p><p>This requires skin elasticity, though. If you were to have a CoolSculpting treatment in an area where the skin has already lost its elasticity, the loose skin would remain even after the fat has been reduced.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_891" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a7a839d44366153014a3b66711350c40">

</div><p>It sounds like an in-person consultation with a board-certified plastic surgeon would be the best way for you to determine whether your skin is sufficiently elastic. (Richard Chaffoo, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting will not cause further laxity if you have good skin quality</em></p><p>In people with good, elastic skin quality, CoolSculpting will not cause further laxity as the skin will tighten naturally as the fat is gradually reduced. If your skin is not as elastic, you may want to consider a skin tightening procedure along with your CoolSculpting.</p><p>I would discuss your concerns with a board-certified, expert dermatologist at an in-person consultation so that they can assess your condition and recommend a custom treatment plan. (William Groff, DO, San Diego Dermatologist)</p><p><strong>Zeltiq and Skin Laxity</strong></p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_892" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Zeltiq is for permanent reduction of fat. It will not affect the laxity of this area one way or another. If you are already somewhat lax in that area – you will likely remain a bit lax after the treatment.</p><p>It should not make the laxity worse. You could always have a skin tightening procedure in conjunction with the Zeltiq to help improve the laxity such as Thermage to help improve that area. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Skin tightening with CoolSculpting</h4><p>CoolSculpting is targeted to remove fat vs tighten loose skin. Some patients do see some skin tightening with their treatments as they lose fat but that is dependent on the laxity of the skin prior to treating.</p><p>While this is a nice effect for some patients we do not promote this as a skin tightening procedure. (Randolph Capone, MD, FACS, Baltimore Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_893" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><em>Will CoolSculpting (Zeltiq) Address Skin Laxity?</em></p><p>CoolSculpting kills 20% to 25% of the fat cells in the treated area but does not correct or address excess loose skin or loss of elasticity or firmness. There are however treatments that can be used in combination with CoolSculpting to address this.</p><p>In our clinic we marry a treatment using CoolSculpting Cryolipolysis for the reduction of fat and the CORE V-FORM to restore collagen to improve the skin’s overall elasticity and firmness.</p><p>I recommend scheduling an in person consultation with a CoolSculpting specialist or preferred physician in your area for a physical evaluation and the opportunity to discuss a custom treatment plan that will deliver the best results for your specific areas of concern.</p><p>By meeting for a consultation, you will know what other types of treatments can be combined to address the skin’s elasticity to achieve your desired results. (Anil Rajani, MD, Portland Physician)</p><p><b>Skin Laxity After CoolSculpting </b></p><p>CoolSculpting by Zeltiq is only a treatment for fat removal. It will not address skin laxity. As with any fat loss procedure, there is the possibility you could see additional skin laxity after the treatment.</p><p>You could always consider a non-invasive skin tightening treatment should you want to improve the area. (Vinay Aggarwal, MD, Los Angeles Physician)</p><p><b>CoolSculpting and skin laxity </b></p><p>Cool Sculpting is strictly for fat reduction and doesn’t tighten skin. If you are already having issues with excess skin, removing the remaining fat may worsen the appearance. I would suggest consulting with a reputable provider in your area to see what the options might be to help you feel more satisfied with your backside. (Bradley Bengtson, MD, FACS, Grand Rapids Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting will remove fat from an area and may have a small amount of a skin tightening effect, however if you have more than minimal skin laxity it can worsen the appearance of excess skin once the fat is removed.</p><p>You may want to have a formal consultation to evaluate the appropriate treatment to get to your optimal results. (Michelle Ellern, DO, Livingston Physician)</p><h3>CoolSculpting and too much skin</h3><p>if there is excess skin and Lois skin, CoolSculpting may not be appropriate as it can worsen the appearance. It may be prudent to consult with a surgeon as it sounds like a more invasive procedure may be more appropriate.</p><p>It is difficult to state without a photo or a consultation. (Hardik Soni, MD (not currently practicing), Summit Emergency Medicine Physician)</p><h3>Will Cool Sculpting (Zeltiq) Address Skin Laxity?</h3><p>If your main concern is skin laxity/excess skin Coolsculpting may not be the best treatment for you. Coolscuplting targets unwanted fat and is not considered a skin tightening treatment. (Brian C. Reuben, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Skin laxity and Coolsculpting</h3><p>Coolsculpting is a fat reduction treatment not a skin tightening treatment. If there is some existing laxity in the area to be treated, Coolsculpting will not do anything but reduce the fat in the area.</p><p>You may think about a surgical approach for skin tightening. If there is no laxity already in the area to be treated then you should have no issues with laxity after the treatment. (Lee B. Daniel, MD, Eugene Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting and skin laxity</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, Coolsculpting does little to tighten the skin. One factor in obtaining a good result is to treat areas that have good skin tone. Surgery would be a better option for those who have to address skin laxity and undesirable excess fat. (Young R. Cho, MD, PhD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Will Cool Sculpting (Zeltiq) Address Skin Laxity?</em></p><p>Although CoolSculpting is great for fat reduction, it does not address skin laxity. Just like with any weight loss regimen, fat reduction treatment and/or liposuction, if the patient does not have good skin laxity, they may or may not see a difference in skin laxity.</p><p>If you already have loose skin and you lose more fat, then most likely a fat reduction treatment or surgery will result in more skin laxity. However, if you have good tightness of the skin and do this treatment, most likely your skin will bounce back nicely. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Cool Sculpting and skin tightening</strong></p><p>Any time you remove fat the body had has to respond. The skin response with Cool Sculpting has been great so far. Although it is not touted as a tightening technology I have not had any issues with patients having loose skin. (Robert Whitfield, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting and Skin Laxity</strong></p><p>CoolSculpting works to permanently reduce fat in the treated area. If you have skin laxity, then that skin laxity will remain. Post treatment, the skin laxity in the area should not worsen significantly. It is always best to obtain a consultation so that you may be evaluated in person. (John Diaz, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
