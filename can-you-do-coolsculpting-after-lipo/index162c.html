<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Coolsculpting should work fine as long as you had enough laxity for your tissue to get sucked into the coolsculpting applicator.</p><p>You should voice your concerns with the coolsculpting provider you used. (Mehdi K. Mazaheri, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting will work after liposuction. Some people don’t notice the changes but photos help with that.</p><p>As long as there is pinchable fat, it can be treated with the Coolsculpting. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I personally had CoolSculpt performed 8 years after having liposuction and it worked well.</p><p>Most patients require more than one treatment to see results and we have had 1 or 2 that required a third treatment. There are rare patients that do not see results with CoolSculpt so it is possible you could be in that category.</p><p>Have your board certified plastic surgeon evaluate your results and give you her/his recommendations. (Patricia A. McGuire, MD, Saint Louis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Many of our CoolSculpting patients have had liposuction in the past.</p><p>Because an invasive procedure such as liposuction does take months to show full results, we do encourage patients to wait 3 months minimum and preferably 6 months up to 12 months post liposuction prior to CoolSculpting in the same area of the liposuction.</p><p>We highly suggest lymphatic drainage techniques after a surgery and after CoolSculpting to help stimulate the lymphatic system to alleviate tissues from excess fluid and mobilize dead fat cells. Our Endermologist is trained in postsurgical Endermologie techniques which we now offer to our post-CoolSculpting patients.</p><p>Endermologie is a noninvasive lipomassage that offers many physical benefits including stimulating the lymphatic system (mobilizing fluids), breaking up of scar tissue, and increasing circulation to name a few and it feels like a deep tissue massage.</p><p>Waiting adequate time after liposuction to have CoolSculpting performed allows the tissues to heal from the surgical procedure and ensures that excessive fat reduction does not occur within the surgical area. (Darin Jackson, MD, Omaha Emergency Medicine Physician)</p><h5>CoolSculpting absolutely works, even with past liposuction</h5><p>CoolSculpting reduces fat. Liposuction does too. But neither process removes all the fat cells from the treated area. Bear in mind that weight gain means your body is holding more fat in all your fat cells, including those still there after lipo or CoolSculpting.</p><p>Bear in mind that a well designed CoolSculpting plan probably requires more than one applicator cycle and without knowing what you received, it is hard to comment on your CoolSculpting experience. But it absolutely works.</p><p>Keeping your weight stable is the best way to maximize the results of either procedure. (Elizabeth Slass Lee, MD, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1961" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>Coolsculpting after liposuction</h3><p>Liposuction does not preclude you from having Coolsculpting. As long as the tissue can be pulled into the applicator then the area can be treated. It may take two treatment sessions in some instances to see noticeable difference. (Arun Rao, MD, Tucson Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Coolsculpting after liposuction</h4><p>If you have fat in your abdomen that you can pinch, even after liposuction, Coolsculpting should work. Most patients need two treatments to an area to get an impressive result. I recommend you see your provider so you can discuss your concerns. (Andrew Campbell, MD, Milwaukee Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is possible there may be more improvement however a consultation is necessary to determine if you are a candidate. The proper placement of the applicator in the inner thigh is very important. As assessment to determine the specific areas of concern you have is necessary in order to determine if coolsculpting this area is an option for you. (Jennifer Cova, DO, Dayton Physician)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1962" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I advise my patients to wait 6-12 months after liposuction before considering a second procedure whether it be additional traditional liposuction or coolsculpting. Liposuction is the gift that keeps on giving and it can take up to a year to see the final results. (Charles W. Spenler, MD, Torrance Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Having cool sculpting after liposuction is more common then you know. Having cool sculpting to have more improvement is a great procedure if you are a candidate. A lot of people turn to cool sculpting after liposuction due to unevenness.</p><p>See a cools sculpting specialist to see if your a great candidate for the procedure. (Jeffrey Goldstein, DO, New York Physician)</p><p>As long as your recovery has been uneventful, Coolscultping is a great option to enhance results after liposuction. (James Silberzweig, MD, New York Radiologist)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1963" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It is possible to have Coolsculpt after lipo if you are an appropriate candidate. It is important to have a consult with a Certified Coolsculpt Technician and they can assess to see if you have enough fat to be treated. (Amy Brenner, MD, Cincinnati OB-GYN)</p><p>If you are completely healed from your liposuction procedure there should be no problem having cool sculpting. Most importantly, it is good that you have realized that maintaining a health diet is important to maintain the results of your liposuction.</p><p>This will also be important following cool sculpting. (Sanjiv Kayastha, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting is a great way to shrink the waist</strong></p><p>In general, as long as the fullness in the waist is from fat (not loose skin), it will improve with Coolsculpting. The best improvements in waist size are from treating the entire abdomen, flanks and back if possible.</p><p>Anywhere that has enough fat that you can grab in your hand, will fit in a Coolsculpting handpiece. Generally, within 2 months, the patient will have a smaller waist, without surgery or scars. (Anne Marie McNeill, MD, PhD, Newport Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Yes you can get coolsculpting after liposuction, in fact all my patients get vanquish and I find excellent outcomes. (Jason Emer, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Can you get CoolSculpting after liposuction?</h4><p>Coolsculpting is a great option to get rid of unwanted fat and reshaping your body without surgery. It can surely be done after liposuction. I suggest that you have a consult with a “Cool Certified” clinic to see if you are a good candidate for coolsculpting (Alain Michon, MD, Ottawa Physician)</p><p>Yes you can do Coolsculpting after liposuction was done on that area. You want to make sure the fat you want to treat is subcutaneous fat (pinch able) and not visceral fat, which can also appear post liposuction. (Drew Varano, MD, Washington DC Physician)</p><p>Coolsculpting can be used after liposuction and is a great way to treat without further surgery. It is able to treat pinchable fat only. Other methods to treat include Vanquish and Sculpsure. All these methods will permanently treat fat but it can come back it eating or exercise habits worsen. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>More fat after Fat transfer surgery, can Coolsculpting help?</i></p><p>Unfortunately, a procedure like fat transfer/Brazilian butt lift is not a prevention for further weight gain, therefore it is absolutely possible to see fat in an alternate/non treated area appear.</p><p>You would highly benefit from keeping a regular exercise routine in place, otherwise further treatment down the road may be required. (Edward Stokes, MD, West Hollywood Physician)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1966" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><b>Cryolipolysis in same area after liposuction</b></p><p>It is possible to obtain further fat reduction with cryolipolysis in an area previously treated with liposuction. You would need to be examined to determine if you might be a good candidate for the procedure or not. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>If you have excess fat, then Coolsculpting is possible. If it is just excess skin, you may want to see a board certified plastic surgeon to tell you your options like surgery vs Pelleve vs Coolsculpting. (Sheila S. Nazarian, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting After Liposuction</strong></p><p>We actually see this very often with people who are not happy with their liposuction results. CoolSculpting can be done to provide further fat reduction or help fix asymmetries, etc. An in-person consultation would be needed to see if your fat is actually treatable. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><p>If you still have an inch or more of “pinchable” abdominal and hip fat after liposuction, there is a good chance that you would be a candidate for CoolSculpting. We have done numerous cases like this and even some to “even out” bulges from uneven liposuction.</p><p>The best thing to do is to seek out a CoolSculpting facility near you for a consultation. (Jason D. Bloom, MD, Philadelphia Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I do see many patients who have great results with CoolSculpting performed after liposuction. Sometimes after liposuction there are still localized areas of excess fat. CoolSculpting is very effective in reducing these areas. It is especially helpful in removing the ridges that often result after liposuction , and smoothing over the surface of the skin from uneven fatty deposits.</p><p>While CoolSculpting is not a treatment intended to tighten the skin, some people do find that their skin retracts nicely. However it would be best to consider a skin tightening treatment to tighten the abdominal skin, if this is indicated in your case, such as Pellevé or Ultherapy.</p><p>In the right hands both of these treatments tighten the skin nicely. (Sheryl D. Clark, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p></div>
