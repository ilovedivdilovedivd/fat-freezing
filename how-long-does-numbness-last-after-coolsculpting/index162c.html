<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Generally, we see that the numbness with Coolsculpting resolves in 2-3 weeks and the degree of numbness varies on the area treated. Usually more numbness is noted with the large applicators on the abdomen as opposed to the small applicators on the back.</p><p>Feel reassured that the numbness is temporary! (Grace Liu, MD, Newport Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Numbness in Coolsculpting treated area</h4><p>It is not uncommon to experience a cutaneous numbness after Coolsculpting. Typically this lasts for a few weeks but may linger up to 6-8 weeks. (Steven Hacker, MD, West Palm Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Numbness with Zeltiq CoolSculpting</em></p><p>Numbness is not uncommon with Zeltiq, but it can take weeks to months for some to see it resolve.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2000" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I am not aware of long term cases of numbness, but as nerve endings can take more time than other tissue to heal, it is realistic to think it can take more than a couple of months. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Numbness after Zeltiq CoolSculpting always goes away</i></p><p>Some patients may experience numbness in the area treated with CoolSculpting. This may last from one to four weeks typically, although some patients may have it for up to eight weeks. It always goes away. (Leyda Elizabeth Bowes, MD (not practicing), Miami Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>It is common for patients to experience some tingling and numbness after has their fat treated with CoolSculpting. In most patients this will resolve spontaneously after several weeks. I know of no cases to date in which it didn’t resolve. (Ted Brezel, MD, Long Island Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>While in most patients the numbness usually resolves in 1-2 weeks, it can be completely normal to experience numbness for 6-8 weeks post treatment and you should expect to regain all of the feeling in the next few weeks. (Rosalyn George, MD, Wilmington Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Numbness can last for several weeks and even past one month. For some patients it does last longer than others. If it persists a couple more weeks I would call your Coolsculpting provider to check in. (Lee B. Daniel, MD, Eugene Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Numbness After CoolSculpting Fat Reduction</b></p><p>Numbness in the treated area is a temporary reaction after CoolSculpting. This is a normal and expected side effect that will usually resolve after several weeks. Some patients do not experience any of the side effects while others feel the numbness, itching, prickling, swelling, bruising, and discomfort.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2002" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>The effectiveness of treatment or expected results are not associated with the amount of side effects that a patient experiences. It has even been reported that a patient will experience numbness and discomfort on one side of the body but not the other.</p><p>CoolSculpting results are achieved after three months. Most of the side effects are expected during the first three weeks. If you have concerns about your reaction it is recommended that you contact your provider. In my Raleigh NC office we offer CoolSculpting Complete which includes dual machines, compression garments, and vibrational therapy.</p><p>The compression garments often relieve many of the uncomfortable symptoms after treatment. As the top CoolSculpting provider in the region, we also offer free CoolSculpting treatments with each treatment purchased. (Michael Law, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Quite normal to be numb after CoolSculpting by Zeltiq</i></p><p>Numbness and sensitivity are quite normal after the treatment with CoolSculpting by Zeltiq in our NYC practice. The nature of the condition varies considerably patient by paitent. the numbness tends to resolve as does the pain over a few weeks but rarely cases take longer.</p><p>The information provided in Dr. Shelton’s answer is for educational purposes only and is not intended to constitute medical advice.</p><p>The information provided should not be relied upon as a substitute for consultations with a qualified health professional who may be familiar with your individual medical needs. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Numbness, followed by tingling and a pins and needles sensation, is not unusual following Coolsculpting. For most the numbness has resolved after one week but for a few it can last 4-6 weeks. Any patients we have treated that have experienced this have resolved completely.</p><p>No one has had lasting numbness. If you are concerned, follow up with the office that treated you but for now, don’t worry. It should resolve soon. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Numbness post CoolSculpting</strong></p><p>Numbness post CoolSculpting is very normal. You may also experience tingling, burning, and even itching for up to a month after your treatment. (Cheryl A. Hull, MD, Rogers Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>CoolSculpting Recovery</b></p><p>You should expect numbness and possibly some tingling in the treatment area for up to one month. This is a completely normal post procedure experience. (Sarah A. Mess, MD, Columbia Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>This is, in fact, normal. We have had patients tell us that the numbness can last anywhere from one week to well over a month. It will pass with time. (Stephen E. Zucker, MD, South Bend Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Swelling, Soreness and Numbness with Coolsculpting</em></p><p>Swelling, soreness and numbness are all very common with Coolsculpting. Do not worry…these symptoms will all subside very soon. If the numbness continues past 3 weeks, please see your doctor who can place you on medication to help with this numbness side effect.</p><p>You need to give at least 8 weeks before you start to see results and sometimes, many individuals require multiple sessions. Again, speak with your doctor to discuss your progress. (Helen Perakis, MD, Nanuet Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Swelling is a very common side effect and can last for a few weeks for some people. Be patient and wait the full 12 weeks to see what your results are. (Jeffrey M. Hartog, DMD, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Coolsculpting, SculpSure, Vanquish for Fat Reducing / Sculptra for Facial Sculpting Collagen Building</h5><p>Sweling can last for weeks after coolsculpting, combine with vanquish and cellutone/z wave and this will improve the outcome and decrease swelling over time. (Jason Emer, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>Numbness, sore, and larger</h5><p>It takes 6-8 weeks to see the effects of Coolsculpting. The other side effects are normal and should subside in a couple weeks. Your measurements won’t decrease by 20%, only the fat treated will. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It takes 4 wks to 3 mo to see some results after treatment. 9 days after treatment all the symptoms you are describing are within normal limits.</p><p>Swelling should be better within couple weeks. Numbness may last longer. It lasted up to 4 wks when I tried CS on myself.

(Larry Lickstein, MD, Fairfax Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is common to have a variety of sensory dysesthesias related to the procedure itself.
