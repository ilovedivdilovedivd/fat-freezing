<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>No need to worry! Sometimes patients experience pain or tingling after Coolsculpting and sometimes they have no issues afterwards.</p><p>Results are not dependent on the amount of discomfort you experience. Your results could take 4 to 5 months, with most people seeing results within 3 months.</p><p>We have treated a large number of clients for inner and outer thighs. The one thing we have noticed is that thighs respond a tad slower than other areas. (Jessica Wright, MD, Austin General Surgeon)</p><p>It is very common for patients to have varying experiences after their CoolSculpting treatment. Some patients may experience bruising, numbness and tenderness while others may have none of these symptoms.</p><p>The good news is that there is not a correlation between post treatment tenderness, swelling, bruising etc. and the effectiveness of CoolSculpting in fat reduction. Most patients will begin to see results around the 6th week after treatment. (Scott Gerrish, DO, Vienna Physician)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1465" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Coolsculpting is a treatment that involves little to no downtime. This is why it is so appealing and often chosen over surgery. The newest applicator, the Cool Advantage, is even more comfortable than the original applicators.</p><p>With that being said, it is common that patients do not experience any bruising or discomfort at all. It is important to follow up with your service provider 3 months after you’ve received your Coolsculpt treatment.</p><p>During this follow up, they will take a series of photographs and compare them to your original photos. This is a great way to visually see your improvement and determine if you need further treatment. (Paul Flashner, MD, Boston Physician)</p><h4>How long does it take for CoolSculpting to work?</h4><p>CoolSculpting is a procedure which has gradual results. It may take two to 6 months to see the end result. The new Advantage applicators are more comfortable and cause fewer side effects, so it would not be unusual to feel no pain and see no bruises.</p><p>This is what makes the treatment so desirable. You can lose fat and not experience discomfort and downtime. Be sure to follow up with your doctor so that your progress can be carefully followed and to determine if another treatment would be recommended. (Alexis Parker, MD, Denver Physician)</p><p>CoolSculpting takes 3-4 months and not everyone feels pain in the treated areas. Follow up with the physician that treated you in 3 months. Each treatment eliminates up to 20% of the fat in the area so it’s common to need more than one treatment. (Robert G. Aycock, MD, FACS, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Treatment evidence after coolsculpting</h4><p>Typically patients will notice some transitory numbness, redness, rarely bruising, itching, burning etc. regardless of which applicator or body part was treated. The newer applicators do hurt less and have shorter treatment times–if immediately after the applicator was removed you saw or felt the cold, and there were no treatment interruption alarms, you should be ok.</p><p>Talk to your provider again and be sure to keep your followup appointment. (Vaishali B. Doolabh, MD, FACS, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Worried that Coolsculpting is not working?</em></p><p>I appreciate your concern however one week is a bit premature as optimal results can take up to 3 months to become apparent. You may see results as early as 4 weeks. It’s very important that you be treated by an experienced and knowledgable coolsculpting specialist who performs the treatment using the correct applicator for your treatment area.</p><p>It’s also important that you were properly assessed as not everyone is a candidate for the coolsculpting treatment. (Philip Solomon, MD, FRCS, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Is CoolSculpting working?</em></p><p>Every patient experiences different symptoms post-op. Some get no swelling or bruising and others have a fair amount. You will need to wait up to 3 months to see the final result, so I would suggest that you just try to be patient and look forward to your results! (Brian K. Reedy, MD, Reading Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>results from CS take up to 3 months and may need several sessions. the process of the fat removal is very gradual and takes time. Most people won’t see results until about 2 months. (Sameer Bashey, MD, Beverly Hills Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>It’s WAY to early to see improvement (don’t worry!)</h5><p>First, it’s normal to NOT have pain, swelling, or bruising! Having no side-effects is a good thing! It takes a few months for you to get the full benefit of the treatment – give it time (much more time.) (Lauren Chavez, MD, Albuquerque Physician)</p><p><b>Worried CoolSculpting not working</b></p><p>The vast majority of patients do not develop pain, bruises or swelling after a CoolSculpting treatment, so I would not be concerned that you do not have any of these issues. It also can take up to 3 months to see the full effect from the treatment. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I would not worry that your CoolSculpting is not working just because you are not experiencing soreness in the area. In my experience, patients get good results regardless of the level of soreness after the procedure.</p><p>The most important thing regarding the treatment is “the freeze”. As long as the area was cold, red and and firm immediately after the treatment you will see results in a few weeks. (John Bergeron, MD, Houston Physician)</p><p>It is still too early to see results from your CoolSculpting treatment. Although some people may see results in as little as 4 weeks, it will take about 3 months for full results to show. Make sure you follow up with your provider for before and after pictures. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><h3>CoolSculpting: 2-3 Months for maximum results</h3><p>CoolSculpting is not a “no pain, no gain” type of procedure. The fact that it is non-invasive and no downtime is part of why millions of people are trying the procedure to begin with! At Imagine Body Sculpting patient education is incredibly important to us, so we always go over potential side-effects with patients.</p><p>Some patients may experience sensations like: numbness, tingling, aching, cramping, swelling, temporary redness, itching, or skin sensitivity. Some patients experience one of these symptoms, some experience a combination, and some experience none at all.</p><p>It sounds like you are lucky enough to be having an incredible experience post treatment! We always recommend scheduling a 30 day follow up appointment to discuss your progress with your specialist, and one at 90 days to see your full results.</p><p>At our office most of our patients opt for 2 or 3 rounds of treatments on the inner and outer thighs for best results; consult your specialist and your personalized treatment plan to see what the best choice is for you. (Vincent Marino, MD, Scottsdale Physician)</p></div>
