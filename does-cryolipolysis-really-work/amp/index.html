<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><b>CoolSculpting Works for Fat Reduction</b></p><p>Yes, Coolsculpting uses cryolipolysis, a specialized technique that freezes fat cells without damaging the surrounding tissues. These cells are then broken down by the body’s own natural metabolic processes over a period of two to four months.</p><p>With each treatment you will see a noticeable reduction of fat from the treated area. (David L. Robbins, MD, FACS, West Des Moines Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>CoolSculpting Effectively Reduces Fat</h3><p>Yes, CoolSculpting really does work. CoolSculpting by Zeltiq uses a patented technology called cryolipolysis (TM) to freeze 20 to 30% of fat cells in a targeted area, instantly killing them.</p><p>The body then takes time to get rid of the dead fat cells through the liver and other normal elimination processes.</p><p>Generally, the areas treated have “pinchable” fat that is easily sucked into the CoolSculpting applicator, where it is subjected to a temperature that is low enough to freeze fat, but not to freeze water in the surrounding skin, muscle and other tissues.</p><p>Recently, Zeltiq came out with two new applicators: CoolSmooth, which can be used on areas without pinchable fat, such as the outer thighs, and the CoolMini, which can be used on small areas, such as the chin.</p><p>In our practice, we apply the Z-wave technology to the frozen fat, which causes even more cell death and even better results. After the fat cells have been killed, they do not return. Providing you do not gain weight, the results you obtained with CoolSculpting will be permanent.</p><p>Please call a board-certified dermatologist to schedule a consultation that will answer all of your questions. (Kimberly Butterwick, MD, San Diego Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Zeltiq Coolscultping works great for removing local fat bulges</em></p><p>Zeltiq or Coolsculpting works great for removing localized fat bulges such as love handles and abdomen. It is safe, easy, natural and effective. (Steven Hacker, MD, West Palm Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Zeltiq is Safe and Effective</i></p><p>Yes Zeltiq does work in patients who have small “pooches” of fat that are difficult to effect with diet and exercise. It is an excellent non-invasive, non-surgical device in properly selected patients with realistic expectations. (Michael A. Persky, MD, Encino Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting by ZELTIQ works and is now FDA approved</em></p><p>In September, 2010, the FDA officially approved CoolSculpting by Zeltiq for non-invasive (non-surgical) fat layer reduction of the love handles/flanks. I was one of the early adopters of the technology, because I saw for myself how well the procedure works.</p><p>It will not replace liposuction, but it can help remove small areas of stubborn fat in people near their ideal weight that have been resistant to exercise and diet. We use it mainly on the love handles, abdomen and back fat.</p><p>The abdomen and back fat areas would be considered an FDA “off-label” use of CoolSculpting. By freezing the fat in these regions, it permanently kills the fat cells to lead to a 20 -25% fat layer reduction with each treatment.</p><p>It can take 2-3 months to see the full results. We usually reevaluate the patient at 2 months to see if another treatment session would be beneficial. Overall, patient satisfaction has been very high in our Naples, Florida office. (Kent V. Hasen, MD, Naples Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_151" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><em>Permanent Fat Removal</em></p><p>Developed by Harvard doctors, Zeltiq destroys fat cells by a process called cryolipolysis. It basically freezes fat cells. The fat cells are cooled until they develop ice crystals within the cell that destroys the cell.</p><p>Over 8-12 weeks the body removes the dead cells and the fat layer shrinks. It is guaranteed to remove at least 20% of the fat cells in the treated area. This fat cell loss is permanent, and the area can be re-treated several times. (David Finkle, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Zeltiq does work!</i></p><p>It has been established in a number of scientific studies that cryolipolysis works in reducing fat cells.</p><p>In our clinical experience Zeltiq produces visible improvements that patients are very happy with. It is not as powerful of a tool as liposuction in reducing large fat pockets but for most of our patients with ‘love handles’ and ‘muffin top’ issues it works very well. (Sam Naficy, MD, FACS, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Zeltiq IS an effective means of reducing unwanted fat.</em></p><p>In every study done so far, cryolipolysis (the Zeltiq procedure) has been proven to be effective in producing about a 20-25% reduction in fat thickness per treatment. It should also be noted that several of these studies were of the greatest scientific value possible, in which evaluations were blind to the procedure and measured by ultrasound, and that patient satisfaction around the world has been uniformly high (unlike other technologies that seem to have more of an “Emperor’s New Clothes” kind of feel to them after some time passes and the initial promises can be evaluated).</p><p>In fact, one of the company’s slogans has been “More Science, Less Fat”. Zeltiq will never replace liposuction or a tummy tuck if that is truly what you need, but it is a safe and effective means of improving your body contour. (Armando Soto, MD, FACS, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting Freezes Fat and Works!</strong></p><p>We have been very pleased with the consistency we see in fat reduction from the CoolSculpting in our office. The device uses Cryolipolysis to freeze fat cells – those cells are eliminated by your body’s own natural elimination process and are gone for good – somewhere around 20-25% reduction to the treated area.</p><p>With liposuction surgery you can eliminate a higher percentage of fat cells to the treated area, but I haven’t seen another non-surgical device that works as consistently for fat reduction. There is a lot of additional research out there beyond what I see in my office.</p><p>It’s a great option for those who want to help contour cetain areas of their body without the downtime or expense of surgery. (Jeffrey W. Hall, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><a href="../49-year-old-man-treated-with-coolsculpting-by-doctor-brian-biesman-md-nashville-oculoplastic-surgeon/index.html"><amp-img class="alignright wp-image-154 size-thumbnail amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2017/12/49-Year-Old-Man-Treated-With-CoolSculpting-By-Doctor-Brian-Biesman-MD-Nashville-Oculoplastic-Surgeon-200x167.html" alt="49 Year Old Man Treated With CoolSculpting By Doctor Brian Biesman, MD, Nashville Oculoplastic Surgeon" width="200" height="167" layout="fixed"></amp-img></a></p><p><em>Yes in our experience it works well</em></p><p>We have been one of the early adapters of Zeltiq and have had great results with the procedure. Zeltiq uses a sophisticated technology that cools the fat cells and causes the destruction of the fatty tissue.</p><p>Over 8-12 weeks the dead fat cells are removed and the results become evident. Zeltiq has just recieved FDA approval. (Amir Moradi, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Yes, Zeltiq works for abdominal and flank fat reduction</h4><p>Based on my research into the product and my first-hand experience with the Zeltiq device, I can attest that Zeltiq is effective for reduction of abdominal and flank fat. It is most optimal for patients that are already quite fit, but have a very localized region of abdominal or ‘love handle’ fat.</p><p>These patients would be ideal liposuction candidates anyway. Zeltiq is not as comprehensive or effective as liposuction, but it is non-invasive. It is not a treatment for skin laxity. Treatments take one hour per region.</p><p>the typical abdomen will require two treatments, possibly three. (Scott C. Sattler, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Definitely works</b></p><p>CoolSculpting has been a very effective alternative to liposuction for many patients. The treatment is brief as it takes an hour per site. It is completely noninvasive and requires no post treatment care (girdles/binders) and no post treatment limitations (right back to the gym!).</p><p>The most effective treatment seems to be achieved by treating the same area twice 30 days between treatments. Like liposuction, however, one needs to be a good candidate–fatty deposit with good overlying skin tone that will allow the tissues to “snap back.”</p><p>Loose skin only becomes more loose with fat reduction no matter how that fat was removed. (Janet Turkle, MD, Indianapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Cool Sculpting rather disappointing as a body sculpting fat reduction procedure.</h5><p>Cool Sculpting is rather disappointing as a body sculpting fat reduction procedure. I have been following this procedure for years and have yet to see a beautifully sculpted body using CoolSculpting. If you want to pay a few thousand dollars to get 20 to 25% fat reduction in a few areas of localized fat, then this is your procedure.</p><p>If you want to get a beautifully sculpted body including many areas for which CoolSculpting has no applicator, then liposuction or SmartLipo is the way to go. Check out the before and after photos for each procedure and make your own decision.</p><p>SmartLipo requires a skilled physician to do a great job. One advantage to CoolSculpting is that because it doesn’t do very much, the risk is very low for a bad results. Usually a bad result is that it did nothing. (Mark Taylor, MD, Salt Lake City Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>CoolScultpting by Zeltiq works for fat reduction</b></p><p>Coolscupting by Zeltiq has exceeded our expectations for fat reduction on the abdomen and waist. In initial studies that we performed at our office using beta versions only 22% reduction was seen. In day to day practice with the commercial version of the Zeltiq device, we see far more fat reduction in the right candidates.</p><p>Patient satisfaction has been very high. A non-invasive, effective, liposuction alternative for fat reduction is finally here. (Robert A. Weiss, MD, Baltimore Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting Works!</strong></p><p>Coolsculpting is revolutionary work by Rox Anderson from the Harvard Laser Labs that has been proven in ultrasound studies to reduce the fat in a given area treated about 22%. The great thing about the procedure is that is completely non-invasive, pain-less, permanent, and patient satisfaction is very high.</p><p>The key is to know that the fat reduction is additive with additional treatments so imagine a reduction of 20-25% fat loss per treatment. Therefore, if you two treatments to the same area about two months apart, the results will be much more dramatic 40-50%! (Grace Liu, MD, Newport Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Studies confirm that Zeltiq indeed does reduce fat.</em></p><p>Zeltiq uses “cold technology” to cause fat cells to undergo a natural death over several weeks. Since the other skin structures are not harmed the result is a safe and noninvasive reduction in spot fat. (Susan Van Dyke, MD, Paradise Valley Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Zeltiq actually removes fat cells like liposuction does</em></p><p>Zeltiq actually removes fat cells like liposuction does, although in a lesser amount. The studies are very impressive with this device and it also has not down time. Most patients find it painless too. I have been very pleased so far with what i have seen from it in my office. (Lorrie Klein, MD, Laguna Niguel Dermatologic Surgeon)</p></div>
