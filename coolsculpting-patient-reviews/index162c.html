<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>– The shooting pains are nerves waking up. That is a good thing, hurts a lot… but try to think about it as a good thing (LOL). I am putting Arnicare (Arnica) on, it is helping. I already take Lyrica, so I am hoping it helps and I plan on returning to bikram yoga tomorrow and try to sweat out the dead fat!</p><p>– The 105 degree room seems and bodywork have helped out the pain to the point it is nearly gone. Urine tends to look like someone poured canola oil into the toilet the following day.</p><p>– Sounds like what I went through………..I’m usually pretty tolerant of pain but not this time………….I was to have three treatments…..upper belly, belly and lower belly. Started with upper………………then cancelled the second two. It has been 5 months and there is absolutely not one bit of difference in the area I had treated……………..so, I’m out $1200 and feel stupid for even trying it. The TV ads are full of how simple and easy and painless it is…………….in my opinion this is false advertising! Buyer beware.<br>
– This is my experience. Lots of pain 4th thru 9th day so far. at night up. over the counter pain meds are not working.</p><p>– Are you trying compression garment and curacaine? It really worked for me I didn’t really have any of it, but I sure didn’t get out of compression out of fear, lol. When the itchy, stingy sunburn feel started I rubbed curacaine on it, it is an anti itch cream, I am 4 weeks from 1st session, big cup on tummy, and 2 weeks later had a 2nd in the same place. I am almost fully un-numb now.</p><p>– I will say the lower abdomen was uncomfortable but nothing I could not handle. No pain afterwards.</p><p>– I have three prescriptions. Oxy a muscle relaxer and ambian. Helps a bit. But geeze….I’m day 11 and my hips visually look fine but road rash feeling does not seem to be getting better. I had large devise 2 hours each side. I’m wondering when the pain will go away. I’m not a whimp at all but when nothing can touch you without a piercing sensation seems odd!<br>

</div>– I agree, the office I went to said it would be sore, but never told me it could be this bad. I would never recommend this procedure to anyone. I hope I get some results or my husband will kill me for spending this money!
<p>– I had my tummy reduced in January. I still have a lot of pain. Sometimes,a stabbing deep inside. Would not recommend. But I do like the results.</p><p>– My stomach is also big and I look kid of pregnant. Today I rubbed my handbag on my tummy by accident and it felt like I got stabbed with a knife! I feel a bit constipated too and I am getting depressed !</p><p>– I am reading about people getting massages after the treatment. I’ve got no massage. They have me a paper with some instructions to eat low carbs and exercise or that remaining fat cells could grow 10000 bigger/faster,something like that. I eat healthy most of the time and I exercise a lot. I am now 47kg and I am 1,60m. My normal weight is 50kg. I have always had that bulk of fat under my belly bottom. I talked to the doctor who did my treatment and I told him about people getting neurontin and he finally decided to subscribe it. They are very professional though and they waited a bit before subscribing the medicine. I am trying to be strong and positive,but it’s extremely painful ;-/<br>

</div>– I’m feeling so so, but not 100% and still being distrupted from my sleep. I think with this many complaints something needs to be done or investigated further because it’s becoming rather concerning to me.
<p>– I used lidocaine patches for 10 days they did provide some relief. I didn’t take the nerve blocking medications. Pain does fade I am 3 months post lower ab treatment and I see a result. Lost lot of bloat and down 1 1/2 ” . I haven’t scheduled the 2nd treatment for the abs,supposed to have 2 small devices I’m not ready to deal with that ordeal again would rather exercise more and enjoy the summer than bloat up and be in pain for the month of July!</p><p>– I have been wearing a compression garment as well and it does help with the bloating and the discomfort. Today is day 6. I’m still feeling pain.</p><p>– I had a procedure done last Monday 23rd June and I am in severe discomfort – stinging, burning, itching, nausea the list is endless. I totally agree that the clinic completely minimized the post-procedure pain – I’ve been taking nurofen and paracetamol since Monday evening but with very little effect. My stomach is so swollen I look 5 months pregnant, I’ve even been asked if I am! If I’d known just how awful the after treatment was going to be, I would never have had cool sculpting – my three deliveries of 4.5kg babies seem like a breeze after this… thank God there are forums out there with other people’s experience and symptoms otherwise I’d be seriously freaking out! I feel conned to be honest, all this no downtime spiel is just rubbish, and I was not at all prepared for the aftermath by the clinic. I paid by cheque in three installments, I’ve a good mind to stop the others! I definitely will not be recommending this to others.<br>
– Recently, at my 90-day post procedure office visit, they actually confirmed that I had not had “the results they usually expect”, meaning absolutely no change in my appearance, and credited the entire cost back on my credit card. The refund was a huge surprise, so I do give the doctor kudos for handling it in this manner. It seems that other people have less discomfort and better results than I experienced or the procedure would not continue to be so popular. </p><p>– It’s the middle of the night where I am and the pain is excruciating – the second night in a row where I haven’t slept a wink. I would never, ever have had the procedure if I’d thought it would be even half as bad as this. Nothing relieves the pain now, it’s getting worse as the days go on. I feel so stupid and conned..</p><p>– I had no pain the first time, the 2nd treatment OMG the pain, it hurt so bad. 3 days later the pain was awful. A friend told me to use cortisone cream and wear spandex. That helped ALOT. I did not get any results after 2 treatments 5 months apart. Got a free 6 hr treatment coming up. I am so nervous. I would rather have my money back.</p><p>– Stay away from the large applicator, it’s the one that has the most pain associated with it. If you stick with the smaller applicator it’s not anywhere near as bad. Also, areas like flanks, back are that sensitive. Lower ab is the worst</p><p>– The first time I had the large applicator on my lower abs the pain was brutal, and the recovery was three weeks of unrelenting, insatiable prickling. I agree with the other commenters here that a compression garment or snug pair of yoga pants were, counterintuively, the most comfort. My second round of the same treatment was almost twice as painful as the first, and without doubt the most painful thing I’ve ever done, but since then all quiet on the Southern front, no tingling at all.</p><p>– Painful CoolSculpting is a reality that happens to a minority of people. But, if you are one of the people in the minority, who cares if it doesn’t hurt others. The pain can be quite significant. We are always prepared to prescribe neuron tin, a non-narcotic pain medication that works specifically for nerve pain, the type of pain people experience with Coolsculpting if they have any pain at all.</p><p>– Had the larger cup used on my abdomen last week and it feels like a third-degree burn with the occasional stabbing sensation. I don’t regret having the procedure done, but I wish I had been prepared for the pain. Thankfully I did a little research on here and read that some of you found relief with compression garments…finally got a full nights sleep.</p><p>– If they told people about the pain they would lose clients. And when pain or problems arise, they always tell you it is unusual. You will always be made to feel like you are the oddity. All “mistakes” or complications will be denied and you will be made to feel like you are the “hysterical female.” My experience with plastic surgeons is they are like car salesmen. Once you “drive” that procedure off the lot, they deny everything. And fyi, they cannot take “criticism.” All pre-surgery conversation will be vague and later they will tell you they fully versed you on all possible complications and side effects.</p><p>– I stopped taking Gabapentin because it just made me feel so drugged. Last night I tried massaging hydrocortisone cream and lidocaine cream. It helped tremendously with the shooting pain. I finally was able to sleep, woke up around 1 am and applied some more. That with a combination of cool compresses. I think that patients undergoing this procedure should be well informed about the possibility of excruciating nerve pain and should be given lidocaine cream or patches if and when the nerve pain occurs.</p><p></p>

</div>– I’m using those sports wraps that have the gel inside that you put in the freezer. They are helping, but as soon as I take them off within about 10 minutes I can feel the stabbing and cramping again. 
<p>But I’ll take whatever relief I can get right now. I am drinking tons of water although that doesn’t seem to make any difference with the pain. I’ve seen quite a few people recommend compression garments. The more snug the garment, the worse it feels for me. Maybe that works for others.</p><p>– I had the large applicator done on my lower stomach December 2017. If I hadn’t already had my flanks done first (no pain at all) I’d have NEVER gone back. Finally worked up the courage to have the lower stomach done again but this time with two small applicators. What a world of difference! Still have discomfort but nowhere near what I had with the big applicator.</p><p>–  I see that I’m not alone in the stabbing pain experience. I started taking the gabapentin today and it does help. Not sure if the pain and expense will be worth the results, I sure hope so, and in three months I’ll revisit this thread and post my results. Those who have not had the procedure be forewarned, you can experience pain equivalent to a cattle prod shocking you from the inside every 8 seconds. It’s not a pleasant experience so make sure you have a doctor who can help if this happens to you.</p><p>– I went on a 7 day road trip the day after my CoolSculpt, and by day 4 or 5 I was in horrible pain. But, my philosophy is “I can be in horrible pain sitting at home doing nothing or I can be in horrible pain while seeing beautiful things.” My advice is take some prescription pain meds with you so you have them when you need them. And take an ice pack you can fill over and over again, not one you have to freeze (too time comsumnibg when you need fast relief and are traveling).</p><p></p>

</div>– Large applicator sucked in whole tummy as I am petite and the result was horrible pain from day 3 to day 15. I had swelling which lasted 2 months and after the pain subsided on day 15 the discomfort lasted the entire 2 months. I drank lots of water even tried laxatives for the swelling and the bloat to no avail. It just takes time for the body to heal itself. I did see a result between months 2-5 but as summer faded and exercise level dropped so did result . So I am back to my same old pouch and cancelled the 2nd appointment too much pain too little gain. On to the cavi lipo had 2 sessions far less expensive , it doesn’t hurt at all and I see slight result. Good luck with you recovery I’d keep ice packs handy I were you and try the lidocaine patches won’t cure you but can’t hurt.
<p>– I had 3 large done a week ago yesterday. I wore the compression garment from the start and drink a lot of tea and water. I am in terrible pain. Lately the garment is making it 10x worse. I train 3x a week and exercise daily. It doesn’t hurt as much during that but sitting or trying to sleep is almost impossible. I am supposed to have two more large treatments but I may opt out as this is worse than contractions! I feel I cannot even leave the house!</p><p>– Lower tummy and each side (lower). I am supposed to have 2 large on the upper portion of tummy, but this is so painful and uncomfortable. I have got very little sleep. Luckily I work from home so I can take my computer to my bedroom and lie down and work. But when I have to be at my desk I just start crying. The spa mentioned a topical cream that I think I will pick up today. The compression garment doesn’t help and I think is intensifying the pain as I get short of breath and the only relief is pull it up and away from the area. I hope this doesn’t last for months!</p></div>
