<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><b>CoolSculpting is very safe.</b></p><p>CoolSculpting is a procedure that most people can have done with no problems. The only side effects are some sensitivity and possible light bruising in the area treated for a few days. You should be able to return to normal activities right away, even some of my patients go to the gym the same day!</p><p>While there are some machines that use heat and can cause unwanted issues, the CoolSculpting machine brings the skin right above freezing level for about 1 hour and then the skin returns to normal once the hand piece is taken off.</p><p>You don’t have the risk of burning or injury to the tissues this way. I highly recommend it! (Juan A. Brou, MD, Oklahoma City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Coolsculpting is a very effective and safe treatment for fat reduction</i></p><p>There are risks with all procedures, but the safety of CoolSculpting by Zeltiq has been shown during the last few years of use in our NYC practice. Other treatments have not necessarily proven long term redution. Prior to the acquisition of CoolSculpting in my practice, I researched the alternative devices and felt that Zeltiq’s company had produced the most effective and safe treatment for fat loss.</p><p>The freezing technology in CoolSculpting can be even used on the abdomen and flanks in those patients that have pacemakers! The fat cells die as a response to the freezing.</p><p>There is not just a temporary liquification of fat from the fat cells as can occur in other types of non-invasive fat removal technologies. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Coolsculpting is safe and effective</em></p><p>Coolsculpting is a safe and effective way to treat stubborn, unwanted, localized fat in patients that either aren’t surgical candidates or are just looking to avoid surgery. Coolsculpting freezes fat cells without harm to skin or surrounding tissue.</p><p>Having high blood pressure or sinus tachycardia does not in any way preclude you from having Coolsculpting.</p><p>If after a physical exam and consultation with an office that is experienced in Coolsculpting you are deemed a good candidate there is no reason you couldn’t have it done. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting is Safe in Patients with Medical Conditions like High Blood Pressure. </em></p><p>CoolSculpting is Safe in Patients with Medical Conditions like High Blood Pressure. Sinus tachycardia should not be a concern against having CoolSculpting treatment either. CoolSculpting is an effective modality for fat removal, with the added benefit of not being a surgical procedure.</p><p>It is completely non-invasive, therefore eliminating the need for anesthesia or needles. Consequently, the treatment is very safe to do in patients with medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, tachycardia, etc. CoolSculpting is contraindicated, however, in patients who have hernias (weakness of the abdominal wall precludes doing CoolSculpting on the abdomen) or who have had surgery in the area where treatment is desired, within the previous 6 months.</p><p>And a very rare medical condition, Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH), is a contraindication to receiving CoolSculpting treatment. PNH is diagnosed in childhood and patients who are aware of having this rare condition should not receive CoolSculpting treatment. (Leyda Elizabeth Bowes, MD (not practicing), Miami Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Flu and CoolSculpting</b></p><p>During the CoolSculpting, you will need to lie still. If you feel that you are able to do this, then you may proceed. I know it is hard to take time out of a busy schedule.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4067" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>While it may not be dangerous to have CoolSculpting while you have the flu, rescheduling would make for a much more pleasant experience. (Lillian Schapiro, MD, Atlanta OB-GYN)</p><p>There is no reason you cannot have CoolSculpting while on antibiotics. As long as you feel well enough to lay in the same positon for up to an hour, you should be fine. (Janet Turkle, MD, Indianapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting can be uncomfortable because it is COLD but your condition is not contraindicated. However, if you are recovering from any chilliness, please defer the procedure. After all, it will still be considered “stressful”. (Justin Harper, MD, Columbus Physician)</p><h5>Coolsculpting and while on antibiotics</h5><p>There would be no contraindication to coolsculpting while on antibiotics. Having said that, if you are not feeling well you may not want to sit through the treatment. It may be best to reschedule. (Jean M. Casello, MD, Northborough Physician)</p><p><b>If you’re feeling okay, now – go for it! 🙂</b></p><p>There is no risk in getting the treatment. However, if you still feel ill, I might considering postponing, just to allow your immune system to work on one thing at a time (fighting your illness and then getting rid of dying fat cells!). (Lauren Chavez, MD, Albuquerque Physician)</p><p><b>Coolsculpting outer thighs</b></p><p>Coolsculpting is a very safe procedure especially when treating the outer thighs. Your provider should discuss with you potential side effects and expectations prior to your procedure. There is no down time associated with this procedure.</p><p>You should be able to resume your usual activities. (Jean M. Casello, MD, Northborough Physician)</p><h5>Cool smooth applicator</h5><p>Coolsculpting is considered safe and effective. Side effects usually involve slight swelling, bruising, numbness, tingling, and tightness in the treatment area. Swelling and bruising usually resolves in a week. Swelling is due to a natural inflammatory response.</p><p>The Cool Smooth applicator used on the outer thighs is different than the others as it does not use suction.</p><p>The applicator is placed flat on the area to be treated. You may still experience numbness or tingling for a few weeks.</p><p>You may resume normal activity immediately after treatment. Discuss any concerns with your provider. They may also offer a post treatment regimen. (Jeffrey Hinton, MD, Johnson City OB-GYN)</p><h5>CoolSculpting 4 areas, is it safe?</h5><p>CoolSculpting is safe to have done on multiple areas of the body on the same day. The fat that is killed by the CoolSculpting is eventually removed from the area by your immune system. Since the fat cells don’t move but are removed by immune cells, they won’t travel to other parts of your body. (John Zavell, MD, FACS, Toledo Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting selectively freezes fat cells to induce programmed cell death. It has been FDA cleared to treat abdomen and flanks. It does not require surgery, anesthesia or compression garments and most patients see a result in 1-3 months.</p><p>The fat is eliminated naturally by your body and you don’t need to worry about crystalized fat in your blood stream or organs.many patients have had several sites treated successfully in one day. (Suzanne Kim Doud Galli, MD, PhD, FACS, Washington Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You can certainly have 4 areas done, it is safe and there have been no complications. If you are doing flanks, you can “dual sculpt” and this will save your time in that each side can be done at the same time.</p><p>CoolSculpting is a great way to contour your body without surgery. Really is amazing, and patients are universally thrilled with the results! (Melanie L. Petro, MD, Birmingham Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Haven’t had kids yet.. is Coolsculpting an option?</em></p><p>Yes, it is OK to have Coolsculpting before having kids. This procedure does not affect your ability to have kids in the future. We have had many patients who have not had kids have this performed and are extremely happy with their results. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Coolsculpting before kids</h4><p>There is absolutely no problem having coolsculpting before kids. The loss in fat should have no systemic effect on your body. (Jason Pozner, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>How old to have Coolsculpting?</i></p><p>There are no age limits for Coolsculpting. If you are under 18, you will need a parental consent to do it. Studies were not done in younger patients but results should be similar to the study groups. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Coolsculpting Candidate–Age Limit, Parental Consent</i></p><p>There is no firm age limit for coolsculpting. However, a patient must be a candidate and be able to provide informed consent. If you are under 18, you would need to have parental consent to have the procedure.</p><p>I recommend getting a formal evaluation with a body shaping expert to see if you’re a candidate. (Jason Emer, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Coolsculpting minimal age </em></p><p>There is no set age requirements , but you should be an adult of 18 years of age or older. Your biological systems have not fully developed until age 18. In fact Most practices malpractice coverage won’t cover treatment for individuals under the age of 18 since it is still considered pediatric care. (Drew Varano, MD, Washington DC Physician)</p></div>
