<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>For the properly selected patient Coolsculpting is an excellent option. Yes, it really does work. When properly performed it can result in a 20-25% fat reduction in the treatment area per treatment.</p><p>Like every treatment there are possible side effects, most of which are minor and temporary.</p><p>The most common side effects are swelling, numbness, bruising, and tenderness. I think it is also very important for doctors to be honest with patients about what is reasonable to expect from Coolsculpting and what might require surgery.</p><p>With all of these things taken into account I find patients to be very happy. (Josh Waltzman, MD, MBA, Long Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting Works! </strong></p><p>CoolSculpting is a great option if you are a candidate for it. There are pros and cons to both CoolSculpting and liposuction. Difference in price depends on your treatment plan for each. CoolSculpting is safe, non-invasive, non-surgical, and requires no downtime.</p><p>CoolSculpting may take multiple treatments to reach the results you are looking for. Liposuction can give you the results you want in one treatment, however, there is downtime, small incisions, and usually has to be done under anesthesia.</p><p>CoolSculpting does work so it is a great option if you would rather not have any downtime, but don’t mind gradual results. Some common side effects are numbness, tenderness, and bruising. Some patients experience mild late-onset nerve pains, but these usually don’t affect their daily activities.</p><p>Consult with a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon who offers both liposuction and CoolSculpting to see what your best options are. (Jeffrey M. Hartog, DMD, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Coolsculpting is great</em></p><p>Depending on your particular anatomy and the area that you want treated, Coolsculpting can be a great option. For the abdomen, love handles, double chin, inner and outer thighs, Coolsculpting works very well and is very consistent in it’s ability to give you impressive visible results.</p><p>Some side effects are temporary numbness, bruising, some discomfort and temporary swelling.</p><p>Most people continue to do normal activities after a treatment. Most patients do need two cycles to each area that they want treated, so it’s not unusual to be doing 8 or more cycles.</p><p>See someone with the new Cool Advantage. The treatments are more comfortable and they take half the time of the original Coolsculpt. (Andrew Campbell, MD, Milwaukee Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Good results from coolsculpting?</strong></p><p>Yes! Nine out of ten patients report a noticeable difference after coolsculpting, which induces programmed cell death by selectively freezing fat cells. Some patients require more than one treatment. But it is a wonderful alternative to liposuction since it is not a surgical procedure, and there is no down time or compression garments required. (Suzanne Kim Doud Galli, MD, PhD, FACS, Washington Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3161" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>CoolSculpting is very effective at the permanent removal of approximately 25% of the fat cells in the area(s) that are treated. If more fat loss is desired then additional treatments would be required.</p><p>It accomplishes these results by placing a special applicator over a fat pocket and freezes the fat cells; depending on the applicator used and area treated it will take 35-75 min per cycle.</p><p>We have all the fat cells in our bodies, for life, by the age of around 20 and how big or small those fat cells are depends on our diets, exercise and general health.</p><p>When fat cells are frozen and crystallize they are permanently damaged and removed from the body by natural processes already in place to accomplish the task. Results post treatment are typically seen around three months.</p><p>Gaining weight after CoolSculpting or any fat reduction procedure will increase the size of the remaining fat cells in the body hence good dietary and exercise habits are strongly recommended after these procedures. The only way to know if you are a candidate is to be seen in person for a consultation to assess your areas of concern.</p><p>A center of excellence from CoolSculpting University typically will have the most experience and expertise you seek. (Paul Pietro, MD, Greenville Physician)</p><p><em>Coolsculpting for belly fat/what is it</em></p><p>Coolsculpting is a procedure where the fat cells are frozen, form crystals and rupture. These ruptured fat cells are then reabsorbed and eliminated by the body. The fat cells that are destroyed are permanently gone.</p><p>We do not continue to grow fat cells throughout our lives, If one were to gain weight however the surrounding/remaining fat cells would expandd to accommodate the weight gain.</p><p>We have been doing coolsculpting for about 10 years and the majority of our patients are very happy with the results.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3163" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Consult an experienced provider to see if you are a good candidate for this procedure. (Jean M. Casello, MD, Northborough Physician)</p><p>Coolsculpting is a non-invasive technique to help decrease fat. It freezes the fat so the fat cells breakdown and your body absorbs that over time. It is great for some patients and sometimes each area may require 2-3 treatments.</p><p>It is best to consult with a board certified plastic surgeon to see if you are a candidate for Coolsculpting. (Himansu Shah, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting is a great treatment option to get rid of stubborn fat and results are permanent. During a Coolsculpting treatment an applicator is applied to the targeted area. The applicator will basically freeze the fat cells in that zone.</p><p>Those cells will crystallized and go in apoptosis (they will die) . Your body will slowly remove those cells within a few weeks and you should expect about 20-25 % reduction of the number of fat cells per treated area.</p><p>Results can further be improved up to 50-60%, by adding the Zimmer wave to the Coolsculpting treatment. Coolsculpting is a comfortable procedure, quick, effective and with no down time. I recommend consulting with a Coolscupting certified practice for a proper consultation, and to see if you are a good candidate for coolsculpting. (Alain Michon, MD, Ottawa Physician)</p><p>CoolSculpting targets unwanted fat cells by freezing the cells leading to a natural cell death. Once the cells have died, they are released naturally from your body. Once the body recovers from the treatment and starts the destruction cycle, you begins seeing results.</p><p>A proper consultation with an experienced individual is ideal to ensure that you are a qualified candidate for CoolSculpt. It is a very effective, permanent, non-surgical procedure that can target your stated areas of concern.</p><p>CoolSculpting reduces the number of fat cells in treated areas by about 20% to 25%. Each treatment cycle lasts up to an hour dependent of the applicator used, with no downtime. The number of cycles needed and the number of treatments can be determined during your consultation. (Linda Cecilia Honet, MD, Bloomfield Hills Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>We only offer coolsculpting to patients who we know will have good results. If you are not a good candidate or a different treatment is better, we will let you know. Pain depends on the area… We can let you know what to expect with that as well. (Sheila S. Nazarian, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Cool Sculpting will definitely freeze fat cells, barring any technical problems which is unlikely. If you a have a large amount of fat you may require multiple Cool Sculpting treatments or traditional Liposuction. (Michael L. Workman, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
