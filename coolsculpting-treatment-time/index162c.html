<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h4>CoolSculpting Procedure and Time</h4><p>Depending upon which area you are treating the treatment can last anywhere from 60 to 75 minutes per area. At our practice, we have two CoolSculpting Machines (DualSculpting) and are able to treat two areas at once. For example, if you were to treat your flanks it would take 1 hour as opposed to 2 hours for both sides. It is hard to tell you how many treatments you will need without having a consultation.</p><p>During your consultation the provider will weigh you, analyze your subcutaneous fat to determine whether or not you are a candidate for the treatment and write you a treatment plan that will describe how many sessions you will need to reach your ultimate goal. (Mark Pinsky, MD, Palm Beach Gardens Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>How Long is Your Coolsculpting Procedure</h5><p>Typical Coolsculpting procedures range from 2-5 hours depending on the areas of the body being treated. This is why it is so important to have your Coolsculpting treatment performed in a facility that is equipped with several devices, which can cut treatment time in half! My practice is equipped with multiple devices, flat screen televisions with Netflix, open Wi-Fi, and catering services in all of our Cool Rooms.</p><p>We make the time spent having this procedure done both enjoyable and relaxing. Patients will enjoy a 20-25% fat reduction in the area treated. Some of our patients go on to have secondary treatment to achieve upwards of 50% reduction in the area they are wanting corrected. (Joseph G. Bauer, MD, FACS, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Cool sculpting time update…</h5><p>With the new CoolAdvantage applicators treatment time is almost cut in half to 35 minutes per cycle which is very similar to Sculpsure’s 25 minute treatment time. As well there is a 45% increase in comfort during the procedure with the new applicators. (Matthew Elias, DO, FAAD, Fort Lauderdale Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Coolsculpting- how many and how long?</i></p><p>How many? Well, it depends on exactly where your fat is(it is amazing how different we all are, there is definitely not a standard treatment) and how much you have.</p><p>We have available many different sized and shaped applicators, so would need to work out what combination is most appropriate for you and your concerns.</p><p>Also, you may need 2 sessions(a few weeks apart), depending on how much is there. So, you could need 2,4, or even 8 applications, depending on your problem. This is a fantastic, solid, researched, approved treatment, but skilled assessment and application of applicators is essential and makes all the difference.</p><p>In my clinic, I employ only registered nurses to do these treatments as I feel their medical training and expertise is well worth the extra expense for me as it delivers much better skills for you.</p><p>How long? A few things influence this. in my practice we have 2 machines- so that you can treat 2 ‘areas’ at once to shorten the time. That has been a huge success. In addition, time of each application depends on which applicator is used.</p><p>We now have the newest Advantage applicators available which reduce treatment times from 1hr to 35 mins per applications. You will need to multiply that by the number of applications you are having at a session, plus allow for change-over times.</p><p>CoolSculpting has been a fantastic addition to my practice, and we have really happy patients. You will only know what is best for you if you go and get a skilled professional assessment. (Mark Edinburg, MBBCH, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Coolsculpt for a few hours and see results within 3 months that can last a lifetime</h3><p>How long you need to be at your dermatologist’s office for coolsculpting depends on the areas you want treated and the number of devices in the doctor’s office. The suction end of the device is called an applicator.</p><p>There are many different applicators of different sizes and shapes to fit different area of fat – large, small, over a flat area, slightly rounded area or deeply curved.</p><p>The time an applicator needs to be on to complete the ‘cycle’ (treatment) varies between 35 and 120 minutes.</p><p>With two machines (dualsculpting), two areas that don’t overlap and don’t pull on each other can be treated at the same time. For example, both hips or one hip and the opposite upper abdomen can be treated simultaneously in the same cycle time.</p><p>However, it would be unusual for an upper and lower abdomen to be treated simultaneously. So if you want to do your upper and lower abdomen and flanks, depending on your size and shape, the treatment could take the time of 3 or 4 cycles with dualsculpting.</p><p>Your physician and her staff can give you more precise details based on the plan they make for you.</p><p>Remember to factor in the time between cycles for the staff to either manually massage, or use radiowave (the z wave zimmer we use in our office) to break up the ice crystals to start the process of destroying the unwanted fat.</p><p>Some patients like to get as many cycles done in one day they can, others break up the treatments over weeks based on their schedules. However you do it, in about a month you will start to see the fat reducing and by three months get your results.</p><p>If you like what you see and want more, that is the time to retreat those areas to truly noninvasively sculpt your body. (Heidi A. Waldorf, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h3>Permanent Fat Removal</h3><p>CoolSculpting is an FDA approved device. Please make sure you choose a an experienced physician and medical spa to perform your treatment. Depending on the area and the lifestyle of the person, the amount of time it lasts can vary.</p><p>The device is attaches to the abdomen and flanks (upon other areas of the body). Each area takes one hour of “freezing” time. Cooling is applied causing the fat cell to undergo apoptosis (death of a cell).</p><p>The fat cells begin to die and break down. The broken down cell is then digested by Macrophages, and your body will naturally eliminate the dead cells. Once the Fat cells are destroyed they will not come back.</p><p>If you gain weight after CoolSculpting the remaining fat cells may enlarge as they absorb excess fat. Most patients see results after one treatment, but certain people may require more treatments depending on desired results. (Stephen T. Greenberg, MD, Woodbury Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting treatment times</i></p><p>The length of treatment depends on the treatment head that is used. There are several different treatment heads with treatment times ranging from 35 minutes with some newer heads to 2 hours with older ones, that we no longer use.</p><p>We have 3 machines and frequently treat 3 sites at the same time. this decreases your stay time in our office. The number of treatments depends on the amount of improvement you desire. Each treatment removes an average of 20-25% of the fat within the treatment head. (Maurice M. Vick, Jr., MD, Baton Rouge Urologist)</p><h4>Cool sculpting treatment times</h4><p>This is a great treatment with no needles, no cuts, no anesthesia, and really no downtime. In my practice we have the new cool advantage which can treat an area of the stomach or love-handle in 35 minutes.</p><p>Additionally, we provide 2 machines for a “dual-sculpting” advantage so you can treat both sides of your stomach or waist at once in an easy quick 35-40 minute procedure. Most of our patients catch up on emails, use their phones, or read and listen to music.</p><p>There are also now special probes to treat the neck, thighs, and larger parts of the stomach and treatment times in those area range from 45 minutes to an hour.</p><p>Visit with an experienced cool sculpting provider and ask about the cool advantage and dual sculpting. (Steven M. Camp, MD, Fort Worth Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>CoolSculpting – time of treatment and longevity of results</h3><p>Until recently all CoolSculpting treatments required one hour. Zeltiq, the makers of CoolSculpting, then introduced CoolSmooth Pro – a flat panel for treating outer thighs that takes 1 hour 15 minutes. Last year CoolMini was introduced for the submentum (under the chin, affectionately known as the “turkey neck”), which is a 45 minute treatment.</p><p>This year the traditional applicators have undergone a transformation and are now known as CoolAdvantage applicators — which take either 35 or 45 minutes each (depending on the size). So basically your treatment could range anywhere from 35 to 75 minutes, depending on the applicator.</p><p>Some offices, such as ours, offer DualSculpting where we can attach two CoolSculpting devices at once, so you can have double the treatment in half the time. The number of fat cells we have is from adolescence (and pregnancy).</p><p>The fat cells that are frozen during CoolSculpting go through a process where they die off and are eliminated from the body. Therefore the fat is gone for good. CoolSculpting has been proven in FDA studies to eliminate at least 20% of the fat cells in the affected area.</p><p>Twenty percent may not seem like much to you, but viewing before and after photos will give you a better idea of the significant results! (Joseph E. Mark, MD, Rochester Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
