Cryolipolysis technology is protected by a patent owned by Zeltiq, and the Coolsculpting® device has been tested in a multicenter, effective and safe manner.</p><h4>Competitors</h4><p>The Spanish company Clinpro, having no legal rights, released the LipoCryo device, operating on the principle of cryolipolysis, to the European market.</p><p>However, the court of Paris decided to cease sales of the device and ordered Clinpro to pay a fine in favor of the patent owner, the company Zeltiq.</p><h4>Counterfeits</h4><p>The vast majority of substandard parodies of the Coolsculpting® machines entering the market are made in China. Chinese models are assembled from the lowest quality parts, and settings are set arbitrarily.</p><p>Naturally, manufacturers of such equipment do not think about any clinical tests and licenses. Staff training, additional packages of marketing services are also not offered. Nevertheless, such devices are still very popular due to their extremely low price.</p><h4>Remember that behind the attractive price tag are extremely unpleasant consequences.</h4><p></p>

</ul><h3>How does LipoCryo work?</h3><p>A special sensor is placed on the selected area, to combine the vacuum action to cover the subcutaneous tissue and selective action of the cryotechnology to cool it. Fat cells (adipocytes) in the subcutaneous tissue (under the dermis) are in most cells saturated with fatty acids, and therefore they are especially sensitive to cold;<br>
in contrast, contiguous elements such as blood vessels, peripheral nervous system, melanocytes, fibroblasts or unsaturated fat cells are much less sensitive to cold. This characteristic has a certain effect on the removal of adipocytes without damaging the surrounding tissues.</p><h3>How are fat cells removed?</h3><p>The process of removal of isolated adipocytes as a result of the action of LipoCryo is performed by crystallization, followed by apoptosis and subsequent dissolution of cells with a gradual release of fats over a period of 2 to 6 weeks.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_7487" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>How many sessions are needed?</h3><p>Depending on the thickness of the fat tissue and its desired reduction, it will take from 1 to 3 sessions.

At this time, a decision will be made about the next session.</p><h4>How long does the treatment last?</h4><p>In accordance with the size of the treatment area, it may be necessary to use more than one device to process the entire area. For example, you may need 2 applications for the abdominal area, 1 for the waist on each side, and 2 for the lower back.</p><p>Each application lasts approximately 25 to 35 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fat tissue. Although, depending on the size of the treatment area and the thickness of adipose tissue, the application can last from 20 to 180 minutes.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_7488" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><h4>Who is the ideal candidate for the LipoCryo procedure?</h4><p>LipoCryo is partially targeted at local body fat: an ideal candidate is not a patient with a general obesity, but just a person who wants to reduce body fat in the area, concentrated, for example, in the abdomen, waist, lower back, arms and buttocks.</p><h4>What does the patient feel during and after the procedure?</h4><p>This procedure is not painful for patients; they will notice a slight stress near the treatment area due to the vacuum effect, as well as an intense local feeling of cold, mainly at the beginning of the procedure. And after the session:</p><p>Usually there may be redness and numbness in the treatment area, which can last several hours.<br>
Exceptionally rarely is a mild hematoma, which disappears within a few days. The patient can return to normal life without much discomfort immediately after the session.</p><h4>What is the main difference LipoCryo procedure compared to other procedures?</h4><p>The LipoCryo system for selective and controlled cooling of adipocytes results in a noticeable and natural reduction in adipose tissue, eliminates the traumatic nature of invasive methods (liposuction), and prevents the risk of destructive effects on adjacent tissues that can produce radio frequencies localized by ultrasound or laser signals.</p><h4>Are the results definite?</h4><p>Adipocytes removed by the LipoCryo procedure will first gradually release the fats, before they are definitely absorbed by the process of natural metabolism of the body.</p><h4>A step-by-step process</h4><p>LipoCryo provides a cold to the adipose tissue (the process of extracting heat from the tissue) with a selective and controlled procedure to reach a temperature of less than 10 ° C at the adipocyte level for a predetermined time.</p><p>The maximum inflammatory process occurs approximately 15 days after the session, when adipocytes are surrounded by lymphocytes, histiocytes and other mononuclear cells. At this time, the process of progressive reduction in the number of adipocytes and their size begins.</p><p>In the period from 15 to 30 days, the inflammation will lead to a phagocytic process: macrophages begin to wrap around and digest apoptotic adipocytes to facilitate their progressive removal from the body.</p></div>
