<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>‚Äì I had the procedure on my lower abdomen and I‚Äôm 8 days post. The initial pain I felt was after the application was removed and the massage treatment started. It felt like my skin was torn from my body, but it stopped in about 10 minutes. I went about my normal activities after the procedure, but day 7 these pains I can‚Äôt explain has kept me from sleeping! The side effects are down played. This is some serious pain that should be taken into account before having this procedure. I will post about my results at my 2 weeks check up if any üôÅ</p><p>‚Äì It has taken me a total of two full weeks to get the swelling to start to go away and the pain was the same‚Ä¶.I had to break down and get a nerve block to help. I am on day 15 and my stomach sometimes itches, tingles and some times tickles. But the burning pain is gone. I am going back in two week s to get my hips/flanks done.</p><p>Hopefully two more weeks when I go back will show some results from the painful procedure of my belly or I may not go through with the other procedure on my hips.</p><p>My doctor gave me a nerve block and sleeping pills. The nerve block did NOTHING. In truth, the only thing that worked was ice packs, which I kept on my abdomen 24 hours a day (even changing them out when they got warm in the middle of the night). It made socializing next to impossible.</p><p>‚Äì . I will never do this again and I can‚Äôt believe that they never ever mentioned that it would hurt this much I talked to them on Saturday and told them the pain I was going through and they basically said it would subside, it was normal, it was just part of the process, it meant the fat was burning and it was just something that should be gone in a few days.. well it‚Äôss no less painful today than it was the day after the procedure and I‚Äôm a week into it now</p><p>‚Äì Horrible rapid fire shooting out of nowhere pains! I‚Äôve been taking Tylenol and Advil (high doses), but it‚Äôs not helping enough. I finally broke down and took a 25mg dose of Lyrica an hour ago. But, I think it takes a while (few days or so) to kick in. I‚Äôm just desperate. The place I went to doesn‚Äôt have a doctor who is onsite all the time. He is out until this Friday and I had my procedure last Friday. I can‚Äôt wait! They just told me to load up on Advil at 1200mg doses. I haven‚Äôt slept in 2 days. I was fine on Friday and Saturday‚Ä¶part of Sunday. Then the shooting stabbing pains started but not like this. They told me today would be the worst for sure. Really? I hope so! But according to all these posts, it‚Äôs looking more like 12-14 days of this constant shooting, stabbing pain. Are we all in the minority? Highly unlikely? If someone hasn‚Äôt had this kind of pain for 5 days or 7 days, they aren‚Äôt in the clear. Some folks are all right until a whole week or so later, then bam!</p><p>‚Äì Get neurontin and tylenol. Ice at night..it helps and the spanks help too. I‚Äôm hoping it goes away. Still cramping and burning. At least the itching stopped. That was horrible!! Oh what we do for beauty. My spa also minimized my discomfort but i good big discounts on future therapies. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll do this again ever. It‚Äôs been a week now.</p><p>‚Äì I had cool sculpt on 2/23/17 which was just 3 days ago. They used the large attachment across my abdomen in three spots. It was uncomfortable when the skin was pilled up into the machine, but not terrible. When they took it off, it was numb but also not terrible. I‚Äôm bruised, my skin is numb and my whole lower belly is sore if I rub it but otherwise I‚Äôve had no trouble. It sounds like, from what I‚Äôm reading here, as the numbness wears off and nerves begin to fire again, I‚Äôm going to be perfectly miserable! I‚Äôll keep you posted but as for right now, it‚Äôs fine. I have really not had any problems with the treatment and I‚Äôm sleeping well.</p><p>‚Äì I have a good friend that has one of these machines. I am getting it done soon. What people don‚Äôt realize is that only around 10 to 20 percent of patients get the really bad nerve pain. So the people saying they used ice packs and were fine, its not the same thing. Also, you should NOT TAKE A LOT OF ANTI INFLAMITORIES post cool sculpt treatment as your body needs the inflammation to produce results. This is true with all lasers. Ive worked in medical aesthetics for 10 years and the laser causes an injury and then your body heals. If you take too many you could be hurting your results. P. S. Im a little scared to get it done now because I don‚Äôt want to be one of the ppl that get the bad nerve pain‚Ä¶. Sounds god awful..</p><p>‚Äì I have got laser lipo done on my abs and sides about 2 months ago and I didn‚Äôt have my upper back down so wanted a little help from cryo lipo. However after reading all these reviews I cancelled my appointment today!</p><p>‚Äì I had 4 terribly painful months, and about 8 more with tolerable pain! My stomach was so big that I was unable to wear regular clothes, I could only fit in my daughters maternity shirts and leggings. Every week I felt more bloated than the week before. After 5 months my stomach started going down, but the sensitivity in my skin with the sporadic stinging, burning, pinching, lasted for about a whole year! Hang in there, there‚Äôs nothing else you can do at this point. I didn‚Äôt see magnificent results, however, for a few months after my inflammation subsided, I was able to wear tighter jeans and shirts, I think all due to the fact that I could barely eat with the pain associated with this procedure!! Sorry, we all fell for the promises of a painless slimming miracle‚Ä¶</p><p>‚Äì I‚Äôm on day 12 and taking 1800mg of gabapentin. This is day 8 of taking the gabapentin and it is a graduated dose. My pain is subsiding for sure but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs due to the medication or just because it is wearing off. I don‚Äôt plan on taking the meds for much longer</p><p>‚Äì No one should compare the thighs to the lower abs. Two different areas. The pain is horrific. I‚Äôm on day 7 and I will not be going back for a 2nd treatment. The pain is unlike anything I have ever experienced, menstrual cramps, torn acl, childbirth‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs no comparison. Extremely painfully. I‚Äôm going crazy waiting for this magical day one the pain stops. Some ppl are stating day 9, some day 12, and another claimed by their 3rd week the pain went away. Hang in there- that‚Äôs the only choice we have now. By the way day 5 for me was a touch and go decision to go to the hospital because of the pain intensity. I did not go‚Ä¶but was close. I‚Äôm shocked how they don‚Äôt mention the after pain nor offer options of relief if you experience discomfort. Funny. Well again I‚Äôm not going back. I would not wish this pain on anyone.</p><p>‚Äì I had cool sculpt done today on my flanks and abs. I threw up and almost passed out from the pain but it subsided 10 mins into it. Then my abs were the worse!!!! She told me I needed a large applicator so I said ok‚Ä¶I immediately went white and it was the worst pain I have ever felt. So she did the small applicator which hurt but it subsided. The worst part is when they take it off bc 15 mins after it was burning and pinching. She told me NOONE has reacted like me. I am now afraid of what will happen after these reviews with nerve pain. I am hoping not too much since I only did small applicators. They never said it hurt like this. I was told no pain involved. Im hoping it even worked bc while I was puking I pushed the applicator off and it loosened. When I asked if I messed anything up she said a little but its still in there‚Ä¶I guess I will find out.</p><p>‚Äì I had my lower abdomen done. 1 plate 10 days ago (Thursday) and the 2nd will be a week tomorrow (Tuesday). Both were done with the large applicator. Like many other people, I was fine for the first 3 days and then the excruciating pain from the first cool sculpt treatment onset on Sunday night. I went to the doctor on Monday as I was in so much agony and he prescribed me some Neurotrin (100mg) to take 3x a day. I knew that it may take a few days to kick in so I went for the 2nd lower abdomen treatment the following day, hoping that by the time the pain set in from this round the Neurotrin would kick in a subdue it. That didn‚Äôt happen. I was in so much pain I ended up having to work from home on Friday as the only thing that seemed to help ease some of the extreme discomfort was icing the area. I am lucky enough that I had the option of working from home as there is no way I would have been able to go into the office. I went back to the Doctor Saturday, and this time a different doctor gave me a prescription for Gabapentin (300mg), with instructions to basically double the intake every 2 days. He also advised me to stay home from work until at least Wednesday, as he didn‚Äôt think the medication would take effect until that time. I am feeling a little better at the moment, although I always seem to be somewhat ok in the morning with the pain increasing throughout the day. I still have 1 more treatment with a small applicator on the upper abdomen area. I really want to go through with it as after all this pain I‚Äôve endured, I want to see the best results. Can anyone advise if the upper abdomen area is less sensitive, or am I going to feel the same type of pain that I felt with the lower area. Also, should I get it done now when I am on the Gabapentin, with the hope that it will block any pain that might come out of the 3rd cool sculpt?</p><p>‚Äì I had my lower abs done 6 days ago and my upper 4 days ago. Hey used the flat tool they usually used for the thighs. I am in horrible pain. Stabbing needles and so sensitive. They did 2 hours on each location. This is so freaking painful and I cannot sleep. Miserable</p><p>‚Äì I had my lower abs done 7 days ago, I got back in the morning to follow up and do upper abs. Honestly I haven‚Äôt had any issues, I‚Äôm feeling some pings and pangs but that‚Äôs it, pain to the touch around the 2nd day but that‚Äôs it. I suppose by reading about the pain I‚Äôm lucky, although I do have a high pain tolerance. I‚Äôve worked out 2 times since. It‚Äôs kinda weird the pings and pangs but they come and go. Still feels a bit numb though. I‚Äôm so excited to get on with the next 2 cool sculpt treatments!</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_720" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>‚Äì i had cool sculpt done A week ago today. I feel like I‚Äôm having contractions. They told me to take Motrin which does absolutely nothing. The ice kind of helps, put I can even walk right, sit right and don‚Äôt even think about sleeping. I‚Äôve been able to only cat nap. I‚Äôm calling the place I went to on Monday. Either they give me something or the world will know how they lied about the pain level of this ‚Äúnon evasive‚Äù procedure.</p><p>‚Äì I did 4 hours worth of cool sculpt. They told me for optimal results it‚Äôd better to get it all done in one cool sculpt treatment. Two lower abs plus two verticals. An hour at a time. The massaging was horrible, but they told me it starts the fat burning process. They should have told me I wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep, sit, walk or even laugh comfortably.</p><p>‚Äì I just came back from a doctor‚Äôs office where I was going to do cool sculpt. They did not tell me about the pain and made this sound so easy. I was so excited as I‚Äôm 52, divorced and in good shape except for my sagging tummy from 2 c-sections from big babies (I have a small frame). So the nurse put the gel pack on and attached the first of 4 treatments. Within 3 minutes I was crying so hard I started having an anxiety attack from the pain. She stopped the procedure and refunded my money. She told me she had only one other patient out of 3000 that asked to stop. I came home to do some research and found this blog. I‚Äôm so glad I pulled the plug. The nurse kept telling me ‚Äúyou can do this, it will get better‚Äù. Then they tried to convince me to just have a tummy tuck. I think I will just wear spanx the rest of my life. No thanks. Glad I got my money back.</p></div>
