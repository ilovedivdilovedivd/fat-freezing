<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The best and most accurate way to estimate the number and type of applicators and how many in each area you will need is by a consultation.</p><p>The area of concern has to FELT by the person doing the consult to give you the accurate estimate.</p><p>Sometimes we have to target surrounding areas too to give you the desirable result.</p><p>I would recommend find some good cool sculpting practice in area and go for a consultation since most of them are complimentary. (Ramandeep Sidhu, MD, Issaquah Vascular Surgeon)</p><h3>Coolsculpting applicators and placement</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4234" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Seeing you in person would make it easier to determine exactly which applicators would be required and how they should be placed. Generally, when debulking the lower abs, many practices, including ours, use the Coolmax.</p><p>It covers more than twice as much as one of the smaller applicators. In order to achieve the most aesthetically pleasing results, we follow the line of the bulge. When treating around the abdomen, there is generally a diamond pattern that naturally forms.</p><p>The upper abs sound like they were treated like the upper half of the diamond. We would most likely use the Coolcore applicators that are designed to treat the “core” of the body. Not being able to see you, I cant really say why your provider chose the Coolfit.</p><p>We do not treat directly over the belly button. We rely on the applicators to pull surrounding tissue in and treat the area.</p><p>Other than using the Coolfit instead of the Coolcore applicator, your treatment sounds very routine. I would wait until the 90 day period is over before deciding whether or not you are happy with the results. (Edward Stokes, MD, West Hollywood Physician)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4235" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><h3>CoolMax and CoolFit on Abdomen</h3><p>Some people might think that the CoolFit applicator, because it is a flat applicator, is more appropriate for places like the arm or inner thighs. These spots are where I use the CoolFit the most.</p><p>That being said, I’ve also used the CoolFit on the abdomen and the back. It just really depends on how the fat lines run.</p><p>It can sometimes be difficult to predict the outcome for this procedure. One thing that I have discovered is that CoolSculpting is pretty forgiving about the placement of the applicator. The cold temperature over a broad area and so oftentimes we don’t see a sharp line of demarcation as the results evolve.</p><p>I’ve treated many people around the belly button and they’ve come out looking great. So your results may look completely normal at twelve weeks. (Garry K. Kim, MD, Pasadena Internist)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4236" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-f4830b7b0699a1317eabc0b216d26a4b">

</div><p><em>CoolSculpting applicators</em></p><p>The CoolSculpting applicators are designed to fit many body types. One large applicator would not have adequately fit small frame. Two small applicators in this case will probably contour your abdomen better. (Nina S. Naidu, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>One limitation of Coolsculpting is that you can only cover the area that is used by the applicator ( no more or no less).</p><p>Your “peaks” of subcutaneous fat should be concentrated in the center of the the device applicators . The Coolsculpting company does a very good job to train all its users in proper techniques , but like all medical treatments there is some artistry involved.</p><p>Markings are usually drawn on the patient prior to its placement to assure that the location of the applicators are placed correctly . If the majority of your sq fat was not concentrated around your naval , then there should be no concerns.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4237" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>If you do have some fat around your naval , yet it’s in a ” valley ” this will likely blend into the final results . Lastly , the lower abdomen generally has more sq fat than the upper abdomen in most people , so those results are usually more dramatic /noticeable.</p><p>The upper abdomen is more subtle and changes to the surrounding area are not as subject to what is referred to as “step off ” ( where one area was treated vs not treated ) . Regardless You will have your full answer in a few months when results are finalized. (Drew Varano, MD, Washington DC Physician)</p><h4>Coolsculpting and applicators</h4><p>It is quite common to use the big coolmax applicator at the lower abdomen, and then following up with smaller applicators to the upper abdomen/flanks. Applying them diagonally should not be an issue. (Alain Michon, MD, Ottawa Physician)</p><h5>Coolsculpting Pop off</h5><p>Applicator popped off is not uncommon . It appears you probably had enough exposure time to render appreciatable results ( 29 min and 31 minutes for a planned 35 minute cycle) though your math of 29 minutes with 9 minutes remaining does not add up to 35 minutes.</p><p>Regardless we have seen appreciable results with pop offs and treatments not processed to complete cycle time . Results are subjective and not an ” all or none” phenomenon. So it appears you had at least 85% of an adequate treatment protocol. (Drew Varano, MD, Washington DC Physician)</p><h5>CoolSculpting Procedure</h5><p>The company trains all providers to first activate the suction, apply the applicator to the body, and then turn on the cooling. Following this procedure allows for the safest, most effective treatment and is how the procedure was performed in the CoolSculpting studies.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4239" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>We have had the device for almost 10 years and always follow this procedure. (Kent V. Hasen, MD, Naples Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I have been providing CoolSculpting for my patients since 2010 and yes, the machine is always turned on prior to the applicator attachment.</p><p>The medical device is programmed to have the provider identify the patient as male or female, new or returning patient, and the area being treated.</p><p>It then takes the provider through confirmation of the applicator set up for safety. Once all of this is done and the skin prepared, the suction is turned on and the applicator placed on the skin, or the applicator is applied and then the suction is turned on to prepare for the treatment.</p><p>The cooling is started after all of these steps have been taken. (Alexis Parker, MD, Denver Physician)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4240" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><em>CoolSculpting Application</em></p><p>The provider can place the applicator two ways. One, have the suction turned on first and then the fat is pulled into the cup. The other way is to place the applicator in the marked area and then press the vacuum.</p><p>One is not necessarily better than the other, it’s just which way is more comfortable. Once the applicator is suctioned on then we start the cooling. (Robert G. Aycock, MD, FACS, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>I have an “outie” belly button, can I get Coolsculpting?</strong></p><p>Whether you belly button is an “inie” or an “outie”, you can still get Coolsculpting. One of the only reasons you couldn’t get Coolsculpting is if there is an umbilical hernia around the belly button.</p><p>This should be fairly easy to determine with history and physical exam. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I did want to clarify that CoolSculpting will reduce pockets of fat. For instance the area often To referred to as “saddle bags” on the outer thighs can be reduced. CoolSmooth will not actually change the texture of the skin to make it smoother, or reduce cellulite.</p><p>It will change the shape of the thigh. It is called CoolSmooth because it is the only applicator without suction. With that being said, it would not be a good option for the back of the thigh. (Janet Allenby, DO, Delray Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Coolsculpting and Back Fat</i></p><p>Coolsculpting is a fabulous way to treat fat bulges in various areas of the body. Coolsculpting works extremely well on reducing the fat in a given area with only a one hour of treatment. An in office consultation is the only way to assess if the adaptor can fit and treat the area.</p><p>Please consult a board certified dermatologist with expertise with Coolsculpting. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p><b>CoolSculpting for fat removal of the upper</b></p><p>Some patients of mine have received treatment for upper back fat. In women, the infrabra fat, or the bulge immediately below the bra, is commonly requested to be treated. Our NYC practice has all the applicators that can be used with the CoolSculpting device from Zeltiq.</p><p>As long as there is a localized bulge, that fits into one of the applicators, then CoolSculpting can be effectively used for most patients. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting will not tighten your skin but deminish fat cells. If you have “bat wing” like hanging skin, a brachioplasty operation may be more appropriate. Consult with your doctor. (Frank P. Fechner, MD, Worcester Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Fat removal with CoolSculpting versus liposuction</i></p><p>In a single treatment session, more fat can potentially be removed with liposuction than with CoolSculpting. A single CoolSculpting session will typically destroy about 20-25% of the fat cells in the treated area. With liposuction, more fat than this could be removed if needed.</p><p>If multiple areas are being treated with liposuction, there may be a limit to the amount of fat that can be removed safely in one procedure. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Coolsculpting for a flatter stomach</h4><p>Though not indicated for skin tightening, our patients definitely get skin tightening along with fat reduction in the areas treated with Coolsculpting. For someone who is already thin, applicator placement is crucial so as not to receive dents or unevenness in the treated areas.</p><p>The good news is = Coolsculpting works! If done incorrectly however, the bad news is Coolsculpting works! Consider a face to face consultation with an office and provider that is very experienced with Coolsculpting that can advise you about your treatment options and let you know (after an examination) if you are a good candidate. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting on the abdomen after surgery</strong></p><p>As long as the surgical scars are healed, I would wait six months from the surgery and then you can have Coolsculpting performed. I suggest you consult a board certified dermatologist with experience with Coolsculpting for your evaluation. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h4>Inner thigh fat reduction with Coolscultping</h4><p>Outer thighs can be treated with the Cool Smooth applicator while the inner thighs are treated with the traditional cool sculpting applicator. You should be seen and examined to determine if you can be treated.</p><p>Sometimes bad loop results can be improved with Coolsculpting! Please find an experienced Board Certified Plastic Surgeon and member of the Aesthetic Society using the Smart Beauty Guide. These Plastic Surgeons can guide you on all aspects of facial surgery, breast augmentation and body procedures including CoolSculpting® tummy tucks or mommy makeovers!. (Robert Whitfield, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Beware the “CatchPenny Copycats” of Medical Technology</i></p><p>The unfortunate reality is that when a truly safe, effective, impactful new aesthetic technology is developed (and in this case patented), there will inevitably quickly emerge multiple copycats with cute and similar sounding names hoping to skim some quick revenue by fooling the unsuspecting and hopeful patient.</p><p>As of this writing, I know of NO other treatment based on cryolipolysis (the science of reducing fat by cooling) that is safe and effective. Don’t be penny wise and pound foolish- seek out a Coolsculpting Certified Center. (Armando Soto, MD, FACS, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting after Vaser</strong></p><p>Coolsculpting generally works well to remove focal areas of increased fat. These areas typically need to be large enough to fit into one of the coolsculpting applicators. It sounds like the lumpiness you have is something called a contour irregularity.</p><p>These can usually be improved by doing another round of surgical liposuction to smooth out the irregular areas. I would recommend having a consult with another surgeon of a second opinion. (David A. Sieber, MD, San Francisco Physician)</p><p><strong>Thigh Fat</strong></p><p>The large amount of fat on the inner thigh must be reduced before any tightening procedure will be beneficial. If you have already had CoolSculpting, I recommend that you follow up with your doctor to make sure that you have not had an increase in the amount of inner thigh fat.</p><p>This is a rare side effect called paradoxical adipose hypertrophy. You appear to be a good candidate for liposuction or a few more CoolSculpting treatments. See an expert with experience in both procedures and be sure to ask about the laxity in the skin.
