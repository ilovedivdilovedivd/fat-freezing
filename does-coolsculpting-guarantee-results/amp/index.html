<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>As a physician, there is no procedure that I perform that I can guarantee results. There are many factors that influence what the results will be.</p><p>With coolsculpting we anticipate a 20-25% reduction in the area that is treated.</p><p>The fat cells that are treated are the cells that fit into the applicator cup. It is important that you are a good candidate for this procedure to begin with and that you consult with an experienced provider who can advise you.</p><p>This will ensure that you get the best results possible. (Jean M. Casello, MD, Northborough Physician)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting Guarantee</strong></p><p>Coolsculpting does not guarantee results, although the number of patients who do not respond or respond minimally is so low that it is usually not an issue. Just like any medical procedure, the treatment is performed following the proper technique and we cannot predict how every patient will respond, just like being put on medications, not every patient responds.</p><p>Your best bet for treatment response is to choose a practice that gets great reviews for its coolsculpting and shows you their own before and after photos. most patients are very happy with the results, and it is a super comfortable procedure. (Peter Petropoulos, MD, Potomac Physician)</p><p>There are no guarantees regarding any specific cosmetic surgical treatment which is what you should seek out a qualified practitioner with experience in these procedures.</p><p>Within in person consultation they can let you know if you’re a good candidate for this procedure.</p><p>If you seek out a qualified board certified plastic surgeon who has expertise with this procedure they can also let you know if you are a candidate for any surgical options.

O`Brien, Jr., MD, Saint Petersburg Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3269" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>There is never a guarantees on procedures however patient selection is key for realistic expectations. Everyone should have a proper consultation prior to treatment. In our office we strive for patient satisfaction so photos and weight are always taken before any treatment.. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Results are Amazing But Can’t be Guaranteed</h3><p>Unfortunately, though studies show that 20-25% of fat in the affected area is lost, there’s no guarantee that’s going to be the same for everyone who undergoes the treatment. However, what we’ve observed is that clothes fit better and the silhouette is smoother.</p><p>It also depends on how much you need to lose. It works best on areas of resistant fat – tat is, fat that refuses to go away after diet and exercise. (Justin Harper, MD, Columbus Physician)</p><p><i>Guarantee of results with CoolSculpting</i></p><p>While Zeltiq does not guarantee results with CoolSculpting, the results with treatment are reliable and reproducible: every patient will have a reduction in the fat in the treated area(s) of 20 to 28%. The number of fat cells eliminated is not measured during treatment.</p><p>The average human has 30 billion fat cells. It is likely that the reduction with treatment is in the low millions. (Sheryl D. Clark, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p>It is impossible to guarantee results for any thing in medicine. Most patient have around a 20% reduction of fat from each treatment. I explain it like skimming the top off a mountain. All the cells that are going to die are gone at the end of the treatment, but it takes up to 3 months for them to be removed from the area. (Michelle Ellern, DO, Livingston Physician)</p><h3>CoolSculpting Is Permanent</h3><p>CoolSculpting® fat reduction, like liposuction, is permanent. The fat that is destroyed will not return. If you gain weight, the remaining fat cells will increase in size, but the number of fat cells will not multiply.</p><p>The exception to this “rule” is that if you become morbidly obese, then the fat cells will multiply and you will undo the effects of the procedure. Pregnancy will not change the number of fat cells; the weight gain will increase the size of the cells, and they should return to their pre-pregnancy state after weight loss.</p><p>Repeated treatments are safe, and there are no long-term health effects related to the treatments. (Louis C. Cutolo, Jr., MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Fat Cells and CoolSculpting </b></p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3272" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Some fat is always left behind no matter what treatment you choose. If you become pregnant you do gain weight and fat cells do enlarge.</p><p>If you gain a large amount of weight all fat cells everywhere get larger. You can do liposuction a second time in the same area, but with laser lipo and Vaser ultrasound lipo, there is some scarring underneath the skin, which makes a second procedure harder.</p><p>This is not true with CoolSculpting, Yes, you can safely and effectively do multiple procedures in the same areas with CoolSculpting and yes, I am impressed with the results.</p><p>There are no cancer risks seen over the history of liposuction, i.e. suction trauma, heat injury with lasers or using cold during treatment as with CoolSculpting. (Douglas J. Key, MD, Portland Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>The CoolSculpting Fat Loss is Permanent</b></p><p>CoolSculpting causes fat cells to be frozen and irreversibly undergo a process of cell death.</p><p>Thus, this fat is permanently eliminated. If you gain weight, as with pregnancy, the remaining fat cells could expand. However, for patients who maintain their weight and continue to live a healthy lifestyle, the results should continue for many years.</p><p>At this point, some have observed several years of continued improvement after CoolSculpting, but no one can say at this point that it only lasts 10-15 years. Repeated treatments in the same area are indeed safe.</p><p>There is no known cancer risk or long-term tissue damage. (Ryan Greene, MD, PhD, Fort Lauderdale Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Lasting effects from CoolSculpting</h4><p>The fat cells that reach the designated cooling temperature are gone. You do need to remember that CoolSculpting is not meant to be a weight loss procedure, but a fat pocket targeting procedure.</p><p>Patients who show the best results are those who are close to their ideal weight who have isolated areas of fat accumulation that are not responding to exercise or diet. Fat cells themselves do not multiply, but they can expand and weight gain that is not muscle will certainly enlarge fat cells over the entire body, including in the same areas where you were treated.</p><p>The treatment is FDA approved and safe. The affected fat cells disintegrate slowly and are swept out of the body in a way that does not trigger increased blood fats. The skin does not “freeze” at the same temperature as fat cells, so no collateral damage occurs.</p><p>There has been no correlation to cancer risks. (Rebecca Fitzgerald, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>CoolSculpting-induced Fat Cell Death is Irreversible and a Permanent Process</h3><p>CoolSculpting offers a highly effective and biologically selective non-invasive modality to eliminate fat. The results so far have been permanent with some of the earliest treatments having been performed more than five years ago, and the areas if excess fat have not returned.</p><p>CoolSculpting-induced Fat Cell Death is Irreversible and a Permanent Process, therefore this explains the lasting results that we are seeing. With CoolSculpting the fat cell actually dies and then in gradually eliminated after the treatment over the following few months.</p><p>Maximum results from treatment may be seen after two to three months. (Leyda Elizabeth Bowes, MD (not practicing), Miami Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting Results</strong></p><p>The fat cells that get frozen off in a coolsculpting treatment are permanently eliminated from your body. In a best case scenario, you can expect up to 35% of the fat cells in a treated area to be permanently frozen.</p><p>However, if you gain weight, other fat cells in the area can increase in size which will mask the results of your coolsculpting treatment. That is why it is important to maintain a healthy diet and exercise so you can get the best results from your coolsculpting procedure.</p><p>There is no harm in doing multiple treatments to the same area. It is done often. There have been no long term adverse effects with the coolsculpting treatment, but please remember that the treatment is still very young (only a few years old).</p><p>It is important that you discuss everything with your provider prior to committing to a coolsculpting treatment. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><p><i>Are Coolsculpting results TRULY permanent? Also, are repeated treatments safe?</i></p><p>Coolsculpting treatments are permanent as fat cells are removed (similar to liposuction results). When you gain weight, such as in pregnancy, you do not gain more fat cells but the current ones expand. These can shrink back again if you lose weight. (Daniel Shapiro, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
