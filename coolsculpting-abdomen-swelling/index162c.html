<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h5>Swelling is Normal after Coolsculpting</h5><p>It is common to have swelling in the areas treated with Coolsculpting. Swelling in the abdomen is normal, and typically subsides within 7-10 days after treatment.</p><p>The amount of Coolsculpting swelling is determined by how many cycles were done, if there was any bruising post treatement, and the area of treatment. (Thomas E. Kaniff, MD, FACS, Sacramento Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting has improved quite a bit. The applicators are much more efficient and the procedure does not take as long as it did originally.</p><p>Many patients experienced severe latent pain as well.</p><p>The most common area for swelling and discomfort is in the abdominal area since the larger applicators are used to freeze the fat, and there is typically much more fat to get rid of in the belly.</p><p>However, most patients do not feel that it is unbearable. We advise our patients to wear a form fitting camisole or for men, a fitted undershirt to minimize the swelling; this also helps reduce the sensitivity of the skin that some patients report particularly in the abdomen.</p><p>These side effects subside after about a week, and the swelling is noticeably better as well. (Mark E. Mason, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Swelling after CoolSculpting</h3><p>Patients treated with CoolSculpting may experience redness, bruising, swelling, tenderness, cramping and aching during and/or after the procedure.</p><p>Patients see their best results between 8-12 weeks. (Jon Paul Trevisani, MD, FACS, Maitland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>This is a very normal side affect as this procedure. It should resolve in a few days. The swelling can last up to a few weeks.</p><p>I would follow up with your technician if these symptoms don’t resolve. (Jeffrey B. Wise, MD, FACS, Wayne Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Bloating, swelling and even bruising can occur after Coolsculpting and usually resolves within 1-2 weeks. (Patrick M. Moore, MD, Murrieta General Surgeon)</p><h5>CoolSculpting Swelling</h5><p>Post treatment swelling is expected with CoolSculpting and is generally not a concern. A 1.5 lb. weight gain is also not something I would worry about. With such a small weight change, hydration status is often the cause.</p><p>CoolSculpting results take a minimum of 4 weeks to be seen (sometimes up to 3 months for full benefit), so I would reassess your results over the next few months. Maintaining your weight though diet and exercise are important, as you may not be able to perceive the Coolsculpt improvement if your weight increases significantly.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_852" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>I do recommend following up with the provider that performed the treatment if you have any specific concerns. (Umang Mehta, MD, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Post Treatment Swelling</h5><p>Post inflammation is not uncommon especially if treated in the abdomen. Some patients may experience mild swelling, tenderness and nerve pain that feels like pins and needles. Though this can be uncomfortable for some it will self resolve within a couple weeks. (Sheila S. Nazarian, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Is Abdominal Swelling Normal After CoolSculpting?</strong></p><p>Abdominal swelling after a Coolsculpting procedure is totally normal and to be expected in most patients.</p><p>The cooling process causes inflammation and this reaction is what helps the body get rid of the unwanted fat cells.</p><p>Immediately after the Coolsculpting procedure, the area will look red and feel tender from the suction and the majority of the swelling will usually be in the first 5 to 7 days. Tenderness and numbness are also associated with treating the abdomen and these symptoms can last up to 3-4 weeks.</p><p>Consult your Physician or Coolsculpting Technician if your symptoms persist. (Frank J. Baron, MD, Mercer Island Dermatologist)</p><p>It is normal for your abdomen to be swollen after CoolSculpting, particularly when the larger applicator is used. Massage, ice or heat (whichever feels better), and time will take care of it. (Carmen Kavali, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Swelling is very normal after Coolsculpting</h4><p>what you are experiencing is entirely normal after the Coolsculpting procedure, especially in the abdomen. The process of fat cells dying is actually an inflammation process so it is normal to feel the effects of that inflammation.</p><p>I expect your swelling will resolve itself in around a week or two. (David P. Rapaport, MD, FACS, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Swelling side effects</i></p><p>Swelling is an inflammatory response that will occur after the procedure. The inflammatory response is your body’s natural defense to begin healing. Inflammatory cells come to the area where the fat cells have been frozen and begin to die from lipolysis.</p><p>The swelling may feel itchy and ache for up to 7 days and then you will gradually notice the feeling goes away. If the swelling or inflammation (same thing) persist and you notice oozing you should follow up with your healthcare provided who performed the procedure.</p><p>It’s important to have this procedure who understands the science behind fat cell lipolysis and how to optimize the results. (Rosalind Jackson, MD, Miamisburg OB-GYN)</p><p><b>Abdominal Swelling Normal After CoolSculpting</b></p><p>Swelling post Coolsculpting is not uncommon, and it is usually a result of water retention. Typically, the swelling will resolve itself in 2 – 3 weeks. If swelling persists, then contact your physician or discuss in your follow up visit. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Side effects of Coolsculpting on abdomen</strong></p><p>Swelling is completely normal, especially when you are treated in the abdominal area. Swelling may last as long as two weeks.</p><p>The majority of the swelling and sensitivity will be during the first week. By the end of the second week you will begin to feel less bloated.</p><p>You may continue to be sensitive, sore and numb for an additional 2-3 weeks. By week six you will begin to notice a reduction in volume.</p><p>Remember to drink water and stay active to allow for proper lymphatic drainage. (Pamela Gallagher, MD, Long Island Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Swelling after CoolSculpting</h3><p>A little bit of sweeling/bloating is perfectly normal after a CoolSculpt procedure. It should go down in 1-2 weeks and then you should start to see some results shortly after! (DeEtta M. Gray, MD, Bellevue Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>You can definitely have swelling, particularly to the abdomen with CoolSculpting. The weight gain is most likely related to the swelling. Many will report a “bloated” feeling for up to 1-2 weeks. (Jeffrey W. Hall, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Swelling after Coolsculpting</b></p><p>What you are seeing is the results of inflammation. You may be noticing more swelling on the lower abdomen where more trauma has been caused.</p><p>It is very normal for this to happen after a Coolsculpting treatment and can remain swollen for up to 2-3 weeks. (Davin Lim, MBBS, FACD, Brisbane Dermatologist)</p><p><i>Swelling post Coolsculpting</i></p><p>Swelling post Coolscupting is a very common side effect, especially in the abdomen region. Swelling can last for several days up to a few weeks. To alleviate the discomfort associated with this side effect you can wear Spanx garments.</p><p>The swelling should resolve on its own but if it lasts beyond 2 weeks follow up with the provider that performed the treatment. (Lane Smith, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Abdominal Swelling following CoolSculpting</h3><p>Swelling in the abdominal area is common following CoolSculpting. Although this is a non-invasive procedure, swelling and inflammation are a natural response to cryolipolysis (fat freezing) and is indicative that the treatments is doing what it is supposed to.</p><p>You may experience side effects such as redness, bruising, swelling, tenderness and cramping following treatment, but the good news is that these effects are transitory; lasting between a few days to a few weeks—and most patients consider the temporary discomfort well worth it when their results become visible. (Jia Zheng, MD, Vancouver Physician)</p><p><em>Abdominal Swelling </em></p><p>Some abdominal swelling post procedure is a common side effect, however, the applicators have been redesigned in the last year and our patients are experiencing less swelling and discomfort. Generally, swelling will subside in 1-2 weeks.</p><p>Anti-inflammatories such as Celebrex and Aleve, Motrin also can help. (Bradley Bengtson, MD, FACS, Grand Rapids Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
