<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>CoolSculpting is very effective at reducing focal areas of fatty deposits. It is completely non-invasive. There are no needles, incisions, or injections associated with the CoolSculpting process.</p><p>There are no limitations after your CoolSculpting sessions and it is not necessary to wear post treatment compression garmets.</p><p>The final results are typically seen 6 to 10 weeks after each treatment. I most commonly see a 20% to 30 % fat reduction in the treated areas, however I have occasionally seen up to a 50% reduction with a single session.</p><p>You can also receive additional CoolSculpting treatments for an additive effect on the previously treated areas.</p><p>The most common areas treated with CoolSculpting are the abdomen, hips, flanks/love handles, back and bra-line. Laser lipolysis techniques such as SmartLipo are also good techniques for fat reduction.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_924" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>These techniques are invasive in that incisions are made, tumescent fluid is injected into the fatty layer to be treated and optic fibers within a sheath are placed beneath the skin to break up fat cells.</p><p>This is then followed with insertion of a small liposuction cannula to suction out the destroyed fat cells. Therefore by definition this is an invasive process. Laser lipolysis results are more dependent on the surgeons abilities than the laser itself.</p><p>If performed by an experienced surgeon the results can be excellent. I generally recommend laser lipolysis for patients with less focal and more diffuse fatty deposits, who also desire as much fat be removed in one session as possible.</p><p>Laser lipolysis is also very good for patients who need more artistic contouring due to asymmetry etc.</p><p>Whereas I tend to recommend CoolSculpting for patients with more focal fat deposits of the truncal area and also for busy individuals who can tolerate no down time or patients adverse to an “invasive” procedure.

Scott, MD, Sarasota Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_925" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h5>Coolsculpting vs laser lipolysis</h5><p>If by laser lipolysis you are referring to smart lipo which combines laser with actual liposuction, then laser lipolysis (combined with liposuction) is going to deliver more fat reduction You need to understand that laser lipolysis is not typically performed without liposuction.</p><p>First the laser is passed and then the liposuction performed. So in essence this is liposuction. It is debatable and not fact that this is any better than liposuction alone. I personally do not buy into laser lipo.</p><p>It is largely a method to repackage lipo. Vaser lipo which uses ultrasound does provide added benefit.</p><p>The addition of ultrasound to liposuction has been demonstrated to cause more contraction of the tissue and skin.</p><p>That being said Coolsculpting is a totally noninvasive procedure that does not reduce as much as liposuction but is effective. Bottom line, one is surgical, the other non-surgical. Comparison is apples to oranges. If you don’t want surgery, do Coolsculpting.</p><p>If you want surgery, liposuction will always reduce more, laser or no laser, but there is downtime. (Burton M. Sundin, MD, Richmond Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Results are similar</i></p><p>CoolSculpting and laser lipolysis results are similar. Please keep in mind, however, that the ideal CoolSculpting candidate is close to their ideal weight (not obese) and just have a stubborn bulge or two of fat. (Lenore Sikorski, MD, Orange County Dermatologist)</p><h5>Coolsculpting is less painful</h5><p>While both are effective methods of non-invasive fat reduction, the Coolsculpting technique is much more tolerable because cold temperatures cause numbness.</p><p>Many of my patients do work or watch TV during the procedure, and most say that they could barely feel the applicators after 5-7 minutes.</p><p>I recommend seeing a board certified plastic surgeon with experience in body contouring to discuss your options with you.

Rapaport, MD, FACS, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_927" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h5>CoolSculpting Vs Laser Lipolysis</h5><p>CoolSculpting is a non-invasive procedure; laser lipolysis is a minimally invasive procedure. Anyone considering laser lipo must make sure that the person performing it is skilled in lasers and liposuction — this is key to make sure they know how best to use the laser and how best to sculpt — the purpose of the procedure.</p><p>Laser lipo is great — but less and less of it seems to be being performed with the various fat removal non-invasive devices now available, including CoolSculpting. Having options is nice, and you need to learn all about all the procedures to determine which one is best for you. (Michael Gold, MD, Nashville Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>CoolSculpting Vs Laser Lipolysis</h4><p>Coolsculpting is noninvasive while laser lipolysis can describe a wide range of technique which can be noninvasive or invasive. Coolsculpting is the superior technique for larger areas needing fat reduction. Moreover, it is a safer approach as the heat involved in laser lipolysis can damage the tissue and organs around the targeted area.</p><p>Coolsculpting pricing tends to be fairly comparable around the country. Although many practices including ourselves have periodic coolsculpting specials. Laser lipolysis pricing can be comparable to coolsculpting to significantly more expensive depending on the laser lipolysis approach. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Cool Sculpting Results</h5><p>The results of Cool Sculpting can appear as though you have had liposuction done. Cool Sculpting works, it can be done in the office in roughly an hour and then you can get up and go back home, work, or get on a plane! Come in for free consult to find out more in Austin. (Robert Whitfield, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Laser Lipo vs Coolsculpting</i></p><p>Liposuction physically removes the unwanted fat from your body. It is essentially sucked out with thin metal tubes called cannulas. A small incision is necessary. This is an invasive procedure, but most consider it minimally invasive as the incisions are very small and the surgery is just done on the skin.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_929" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>A laser is used during liposuction to melt fat and heat skin in an attempt to tighten it. Coolsculpting is a very different procedure. An applicator is placed on the skin and the applicator cools the skin down to cause a permanent loss of fat cells in that given area.</p><p>There is much less control over this process and each treatment can only reduce the amount of fat 20-25%, at best. Liposuction is essentially sculpture of the body, where coolsculpting is a treatment that can reduce an area of fat excess, although the effect varies from patient to patient. (Shim Ching, MD, Honolulu Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting involves a non-surgical, non-invasive method of destroying fat cells while not damaging the skin and other tissues. Laser lipolysis uses a laser to heat and destroy fat cells which are then aspirated with a regular liposuction cannula.</p><p>This is a surgical procedure requiring some type of anesthesia (local vs general). The comparative results of the different techniques will vary with the area being treated and the characteristics of the overlying skin. My recommendation is to consult with a board certified plastic surgeon who offers both techniques to determine which technique is best suited to your needs. (Kathleen Waldorf, MD, FACS, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Coolsculpting completely non-invasive</b></p><p>Coolsculpting is a completely non-invasive technique whereas typically laser lipolysis is used in combination with liposuction (surgery) such that the fat is treated with the laser and then removed via liposuction. Coolsculpting only treats areas that are able to be fit into the specific handpieces – pinchable fat on the abdomen and hips for example.</p><p>I think the comparison really gets down to surgical vs non-surgical. Many people will get better and more definitive results from surgical liposuction but in the abdomen area in particular there can be significant skin irregularities. (Elizabeth F. Rostan, MD, Charlotte Dermatologist)</p></div>
