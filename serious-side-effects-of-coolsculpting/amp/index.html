<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>For most patients, recovery from Coolsculpting is really uneventful, with little to no side effects. Some people can bruise in the treatment area (from the suction of the applicator) but that resolves in a few days.</p><p>Numbness is not uncommon and usually lasts a few days. In some patients, numbness can last a few weeks but it always resolves.</p><p>A very small percentage of patients experience pain in the treatment area and of those, an even smaller percentage have pain that requires prescription medication.</p><p>Pain, if any, usually lasts about 3-4 days. Coolsculpting is very comfortable and easy procedure to do. Most of our patients find it so easy that they opt for treating other areas as well. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is fairly routine to have temporary numbness to the treated area after a CoolSculpting treatment. The length of time it takes the numbness to resolve can vary, but it can take 4-8 weeks in some people.</p><p>Others find the numbness only lasts a couple of weeks. It is also possible to get temporary discoloration from CoolSculpting. The treated area can have some redness or some bruising, but if these occur, it usually only takes days to a week or so for it to resolve.</p><p>Pain after the treatment can vary. Most people have little or no pain, but it is possible to develop some stabbing pain, which can be treated with a specific type of prescription medication.</p><p>The most likely area to have this stabbing pain is the front of the abdomen when the larger applicator is used. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>CoolSculpting side effects</b></p><p>There are several serious side effects with CoolSculpting. Most people develop some numbness to the treated area, which can last several weeks up to 2 months. It is possible to have some temporary redness or bruising to the treated area, and this can last just a few days or a few weeks.</p><p>In rare instances, primarily in treatment to the abdomen, it is possible to have some sharp pain after the procedure. This normally can be managed with medication if needed. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Coolsculpting works well but what are possible side effects. </em></p><p>The most common side effects are bruising and numbness. Occasionally, there is pain that persists for a few weeks. This is improved with topical numbing creams or oral medications. About 1 in 10,000 have enlargement of their fat.</p><p>About 10% of treatments have no results but most people are happy with their results as one can see with the rating on Realself. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>CoolSculpting and risks</b></p><p>CoolSculpting is quick, easy, without downtime and with minimal side effects. This is why it is the #1 non-invasive fat removal system in the world.</p><p>It is great at removing fat at stubborn areas. Mild swelling and discomfort at the treated area are the most common side effects.</p><p>They usually resolve within a few days to weeks after treatment. I recommend seeing a CoolSculpting certified practice. (Alain Michon, MD, Ottawa Physician)</p><h3>Risks and bad side effects of CoolSculpting</h3><p>Risks from CoolSculpting are minimal-probably the worst case scenario is the CoolSculpting device not being placed on the precise area to be treated, resulting in fat removal from an area that was not meant to be treated, while leaving the fat (that was supposed to be removed) still in place.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1976" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I suggest having an inexperienced provider perform your treatment to reduce this risk. Bad side effects are also minimal – usually just discomfort or numbness in the treated area as well as some bruising but for most patients this is just an annoyance and doesn’t keep them from their usual activities.</p><p>There are 2 serious side effects that are very rare but are more problematic – intense pain in the treated site that can last a few weeks and may need narcotics or Neurontin to help relieve the pain.</p><p>The other is paradoxical fat hypertrophy where the area initially seems to get smaller but somehow the fat cells that are remaining are super-stimulated and grow much bigger, resulting in fat deposition in the treated area that is even larger than the original amount.</p><p>This is easily treated with liposuction or LaserLipo and the cost is generally covered by the CoolSculpting company if pre- and post treatment photos show that this happened. Certainly, these bad effects are so rare that I would not let them deter you from this treatment if you are a good candidate. (Mary Beth Mudd, MD, Columbus Physician)</p><p>CoolSculpting definitely works! It will remove 20-30% of the fat in the treatment area. The most common side effects are numbness and cramping. There can be more intense side effects that are very limited.</p><p>There is a new line of coolsculpting applicators called cool advantage. They are more effective, and the side effects are more mild. (Janet Allenby, DO, Delray Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Side Effects of Coolsculpting</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1978" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Nerve pain and the stinging pain. Also swelling is common for the first 2 weeks after treatment. I would follow up with your physician for medication to help alleviate the pain. Good luck with your recovery. (Michelle Ellern, DO, Livingston Physician)</p><p>Some patients do experience side effects (usually when the abdomen is treated), but normally after 2-3 weeks, the side effects go away. Keep in close communication with your doctor and they should be able to get you through this. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Not common to have severe pain from CoolSculpting</h3><p>Although it is not common to experience the sharp pain that has prevented your sleeping, after CoolSculpting, some people do.</p><p>These symptoms tend to go away on their own, but if there is no contraindication to taking a non-steroidal antiinflammatory agent, your doctor may wish to recommend such.</p><p>Also, there might be a chance that a physical therapists, external ultrasound treatment could make it more comfortable. Unfortunately, I would have to say there is no guarantee about the latter, and in fact, there might be a risk it could make it worse.</p><p>You would probably know during the treatment if it feels good, it probably will help, but if it makes it worse during the treatment you could ask for it to be stopped. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Side Effects of Zeltiq</strong></p><p>Typically, there is minimal to no downtime after the treatment though patients may experience temporary pain or discomfort. Side effects can include redness, bruising, swelling, tenderness to the touch, cramping, itching, tingling, and numbness. Numbness can persist up to several weeks after a procedure.</p><p>In time, these side effects will subside. (Daniel Shapiro, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>CoolSculpting – Extreme Side Effects</b></p><p>It is not unusual to have swelling and inflammation post treatment. With the coolmax applicator (the largest applicator), there may be 1 day of soreness which sets in generally about 4 days post treatment. It generally will last 1 day.</p><p>Patients with too little fat to normally treat with coolmax will have a more extreme reaction. Ensure that you go to a Certified Coolsculpting Center where the treatments have direct involvement of an experienced and expert board certified plastic surgeon for the best quality treatment. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting Side Effects</strong></p><p>Sometimes nerve pain can be a result of treatment with coolsculpting, especially with the CoolMax applicator. The never pain can have a delayed and prolonged onset. Over the counter pain meds can be helpful, but you may also ask your provider if they recommend a prescription medication for nerve pain such as neurontin.</p><p>Many patients also find relief with some compression on the area as well. All of the symptoms normally always get better with time.</p><p>Definitely consult with your provider if things do not improve. (Steven H. Williams, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Pain Following CoolSculpting Usually Resolves In 2-3 Days</i></p><p>It’s not unusual for patients to experience some pain following abdominal coolsculpting. This pain is often described as dull and achy and typically improves in 2-3 days. Rarely the pain is more severe and is characterized as sharp and stabbing.</p><p>The origin of this pain is unclear, but is probably related to traction on the soft tissue related to the suction from the applicator device. The pain usually resolves spontaneously without treatment. Occasionally, non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents may be used to minimize pain following this procedure. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
