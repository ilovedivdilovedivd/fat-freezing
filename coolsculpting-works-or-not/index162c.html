<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><i>CoolSculpting right for me?</i></p><p>If you can pinch an inch or more of skin and fat between your fingers, CoolSculpting will reduce it. Someone who is slim and healthy but has localized areas of fat that do not go away with a healthy diet and exercise is the ideal candidate.</p><p>The treatment gives the same result in every patient: 20 to 28% (the latter if the fat is massaged appropriately after the applicator is removed) of fat cells die and do not return in the treated area.</p><p>Although obviously you need to consider whether CoolSculpting is within your budget (and many offices offer one or more payment plans), I would not consider a treatment that has reliable, reproducible results and permanent results in every patient and performed on someone who is an ideal candidate to be a waste of money! (Sheryl D. Clark, MD, New York Dermatologist)<br>
An examination would be needed to ultimately determine if the procedure would be of benefit to you.  With a single treatment session of CoolSculpting, normally about 20-25% of the fat cells in the treated area will be destroyed.  (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>COOL SCULPTING WORKS LIKE LIPOSUCTION</i></p><p>We have extensive experience with Coolsculpting and none of it is negative. Over the years, the technique has developed to use overlapping treatments , all on the same day, to result in liposuction- like results.</p><p>You should get a very nice result with Coolsculpting on all areas of concern . After you are done with that, I would recommend treating the abdominal wall with Thermismooth250, a revolutionary tightening office procedure , to tighten the skin even further. Do not expect much tightening from the Coolsculpting treatments. (Ahmet R. Karaca, MD, Birmingham Plastic Surgeon)<br>
<strong>Does CoolSculpting work on upper back and arms?</strong></p><p>CoolSculpting can be used to reduce fat on the upper back and the arms, but these are considered off-label uses. You would need to be examined to determine if you might be a good candidate for treatment in either of these areas. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>While the arms and back are not the primary areas for our patients, we have performed Coolsculpting in these regions with great success and pleasing responses. In particular, our patients noted better fitting clothing along the arm and back and reduced bulge particularly along the bra line.</p><p>Both volume reduction and firming of the skin have occurred. Having said that, the applicators fit properly and the patients were also motivated to change lifestyles and reduce their weights. CoolSculpting results are limited but it is non-surgical with its benefits.<br>

</div>Liposuction is best for those patients wishing for a greater contouring result. Please consider it for the arms and back using a well experienced Board Certified Plastic Surgeon.(Dean P. Kane, MD, FACS, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)
<h5>Coolsculpting on back and back of arms</h5><p>CoolSculpting can be used to reduce fat on the upper back and the arms, however, these areas are considered “off-label”. You would need to be consulted with a provider in your area to determine if you might be a good candidate for the treatment. (Cheryl A. Hull, MD, Rogers Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>The most important factor in determining whether CoolSculpting is appropriate for any area of the body is to be evaluated by a practitioner who has extensive experience. If an area is evaluated poorly, results will be minimal.<br>

</div>These areas are considered off-label, so a physician must direct the procedure and authorize its use in these areas. That being said, in the right patient, these areas can be treated and our patients value the non-invasive nature of CoolSculpting.
<p>Being a plastic surgeon, fat of the back can be more fibrous and therefore more difficult to sculpt with liposuction and sometimes CoolSculpting becomes a more elegant solution, bearing in mind that more than one treatment may be needed. (Deborah Pan, MD, New Haven Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>CoolSculpting under the chin</b></p><p>  The official recommendation regarding treatment of the under chin area with CoolSculpting is that 3 treatments will most likely be needed for best possible results.  We offer a deal: buy two areas and get one free, when treating under the chin.<br>

</div>  Each treatment will remove 20-25% of the fat, and this is rarely enough to fully remove a stubborn pocket of fat such as the double chin.  Additionally, it is often necessary to treat this area with side by side, overlapping applications to really cover the entire area.
<p>  We always educate our patients during the consultation so that they are aware of how many treatments will be needed and how the applicators will be placed. Although there are other options such as Kybella, it sounds as though you simply need to finish a proper treatment plan with CoolSculpting. (Edward Stokes, MD, West Hollywood Physician)</p><p><em>You may need additional treatment sessions.</em></p><p>In many cases, up to three CoolSculpting® treatment sessions spaced several weeks apart may be necessary in order to achieve the best results. At our practice, we use the “stacking” technique to get better results in a single session instead.<br>
Another possible concern is that CoolSculpting® won’t address excess skin, so if you do lose weight in your chin area, you may notice that the appearance of sagging skin becomes a larger concern. It’s never a bad idea to get a second opinion, especially if you weren’t happy with your initial results.</p><p>I would suggest consulting another board-certified plastic surgeon for a more in-depth assessment of your needs and the best treatment approach. (Jennifer Harrington, MD, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>How much time should you wait before a second treatment?</em></p><p>There is no exact answer to that question. We like to bring our patients back at 30 days post treatment to see how they are coming along. That is when we begin to discuss a second treatment.<br>
How long to wait in between CoolSculpting sessions will depend on the individual, but generally you should wait for full results before having a second treatment done. Full results from a CoolSculpting treatment can take two or three months to appear.</p><p>Generally, the doctor who does your treatment should be able to assess during your first consultation how many treatments it is likely to take to reach your goals and will be able to give you a time frame for sessions. (Kimberly Butterwick, MD, San Diego Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>I wouldn’t do it any sooner than 30 days after the first treatment. (Brian K. Reedy, MD, Reading Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In my practice, we typically re-treat (if indicated) at one month following the initial treatment. You can wait longer, but I wouldn’t do it sooner than that. (Amy M. Sprole, MD, Wichita Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Bra bulge – Zeltiq’s CoolSculpting</h4><p>The bra line are creates bulges that none of us like and they can affect women who are basically thin already. CoolSculpting does help trim this area nicely so you can enjoy a smoother back contour. (Rebecca Fitzgerald, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting for bra fat</em></p><p>We have had excellent success with treating the bra area. I would recommend that you have a consultation with a provider to see if you are a good canidate and discuss your goals. It can really make a great difference in how you look in your clothes. (Jeanie Leddon, MD, Boulder Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Can CoolSculpting applicator be placed horizontally across belly button?</h4><p>Yes, a CoolSculpting applicator can be placed horizontally across the abdomen, including over the belly button.  There is not just one correct placement of applicators when treating someone with CoolSculpting.  In most cases, there are a variety of ways in which the treatment could be done.</p><p> The most important thing is to make sure that all of the areas with the unwanted fat are being treated.  Physicians may have different preferences for applicator placement, but as long as the fat is treated, the result should be good in whichever method is used. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>CoolSculpting over the belly button</b></p><p>CoolSculpting can be done almost any where and in any pattern on the abdomen.  What is most important about the belly button, is to be sure that there is not an umbilical hernia.  For that, you will need an experienced doctor to examine you and determine the status of the abdominal wall.</p><p>  When doing CoolSculpting, it is important to “follow the fat” and treat where the fat lies.  Go to an experienced provider and where there is a doctor who knows medicine before CoolSculpting.  You do not want to end up with an abdominal emergency because there was and undiscovered hernia.
