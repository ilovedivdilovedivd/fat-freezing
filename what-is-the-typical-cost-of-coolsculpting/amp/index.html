<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Typically depending how many treatments are necessary it cost’s about $750 a cycle.</p><p>However several cycles are usually required depending on the area(s) of treatment to receive the desired result. (Jessica Glenn, MD, Howell Family Physician)</p><p>The cost of depends on the size of the treatment head. The smaller one is $750 and the larger is $1500. The cost greatly depends on how many areas are to be treated. For example, the tummy may take two treatments and each flank two small treatment.</p><p>Each case is customized to each patients needs. Also, discounts will apply when you have multiple treatments. Physicians also offer specials at various time. (Miguel Delgado, MD, San Rafael Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting treatment costs</i></p><p>The cost of CoolSculpting treatments will vary depending on how many areas are treated and the patient’s desired outcome. Here in the UK, a single treatment typically starts from £800. At your consultation, your CoolSculpting practitioner will discuss everything in detail, assessing your whole body, taking into account your specific areas of concern.</p><p>This will then determine how much the treatment will cost to achieve the desired results. I hope this helps, Dr Tracy Mountford. (Tracy Mountford, MBBS, London Physician)</p><p><em>Results over cost</em></p><p>While budget is something to consider, your best results will be accomplished by a certified facility with knowledge and experience to advise you of the best treatment option. Typically prices range from 650-750 per cycle, but generally discounted with package pricing.</p><p>Most facilities will offer free consultations to see what would meet your needs. (Michalynn Farley, MD, Redding Physician)</p><p>CoolSculpting costs are usually set by the applicator size and the number of treatments. In our region treatment with the smaller applicator usually starts around $700 to $750, but patients can get preferred pricing if they commit to multiple treatments, and these discounts can be significant with larger packages.</p><p>Purchasing a treatment package not only gives the patient a price break, it gives the patient excellent results. The larger applicator can treat about 2.5X the area of the smaller applicators and is usually priced around twice the smaller applicator.</p><p>If you are treating your stomach and are a candidate for the large applicator it is offers great results and good value. (Sarah A. Mess, MD, Columbia Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting usually costs about the same across practices. Discounts are typically offered when multiple areas are treated, or if a practice has a educational Coolsculpting seminar. Our practice offers Dualsculpting, in which the procedure can be performed in half the time.</p><p>Not all practices offer Dualsculpting, so be sure to ask about it when you are considering a provider. (Alan N. Larsen, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>How much does coolsculpting cost?</em></p><p>The cost of Coolsculpting is based upon how many areas are treated. The price in my office starts at $750 for the first area and each subsequent area is slightly less. (For example, 3 areas is $2100). The cost for the new treatment head for thighs is more as the procedure takes longer on the thighs. (John Zavell, MD, FACS, Toledo Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The most recent event held at our office had significant discounts. Each time an office has a Cool Night Out Event the best pricing is available. (Robert Whitfield, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Cost of CoolSculpting in Las Vegas</h5><p>CoolSculpting begins at $700 per area and prices vary based on number of treatments and number of areas. (Arthur M. Cambeiro, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>CoolSculpting in the MidWest, US Starts at $1500</b></p><p>Coolsculpting represents a significant advance in the treatment of problem fat collections. The technique has been clinically proven and has FDA approval. The cost of coolsculpting is dependent upon multiple variables, but generally starts at about $1500 when a single area is treated with a large applicator.</p><p>Significant discounts occur when multiple areas are treated and when single areas are treated multiple times. Unfortunately, price shopping is difficult, because each provider structures fees differently. In many cases it becomes an apples and oranges comparison.</p><p>Not only is coolsculpting cost effective, but is also safe and has virtually no downtime. In cases where larger amounts of fat are present, other techniques like liposuction may be more cost effective.</p><p>The best way to determine the real cost of coolsculpting is to consult a plastic surgeon who can provide the complete spectrum of therapeutic options for treating localized fat collections. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting cost in Cincinnati</em></p><p>In Cincinnati, CoolSculpting treatments range from $600-$800 for a small area and $800-$1500 for a larger area. Some patients may require subsequent treatments. Many practices also run promotional pricing so the actual cost can be less.</p><p>You will generally see a 25% reduction in fat with each treatment. The procedure is noninvasive and takes 1 hour to complete. We have 2 machines in our practice so we can offer shorter treatment times or treat more than one area at a time.</p><p>Our patients are giving this fat reduction therapy a thumbs up. I have personally had my love handles done 1 month ago and already see a big reduction in fat. (Kurtis Martin, MD, Cincinnati Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Sacramento Coolsculpting Cost</h4><p>Coolsculpting is priced by the number of cycles. At your consultation the number cycles required to reach your goal is determined. Most patients require more than one cycle to reach their goal.</p><p>A single cycle is between $700.00 and $800.00. There is a progressive discount for treatment plans requiring more cycles. (Thomas E. Kaniff, MD, FACS, Sacramento Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Cost of Coolsculpting in NY</em></p><p>The cost of coolsculpting is fairly similar among offices offering the treatment. In our Albany, NY office, the costs are as follows:</p><p>-$750 for one small area or $1500 for 2 small areas. This would be used for treating the lovehandles where the total for both sides would be $1500-$1500 for a large area.</p><p>An example of this would be the lower belly.- When multiple areas are treated, the costs diminish significantly, often by more than 10%. The current trend in coolsculpting is to treat multiple areas at once.</p><p>This “Treatment to Transformation” gives better and more dramatic results. Coolsculpting is an excellent way of removing unwanted fat without surgery. It continues to grow in its popularity. (Jeffrey Rockmore, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting Costs</strong></p><p>In New York, the larger handpiece usually costs $1400.00 to $1600.00 per application.</p><p>The smaller handpiece usually costs $700.00 to $900.00 per application. Offices sometimes offer discounts for multiple applications. (Louis C. Cutolo, Jr., MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>San Francisco CoolSculpting Prices</i></p><p>Typically, cost for CoolSculpting is broken down per treatment. Here in San Francisco, CA we charge $1500 for the first treatment (either 2 small applicators or 1 large applicator) and $1000 for every treatment thereafter.</p><p>You will see results after your first treatment, but depending on your body type a physician may recommend a series of treatments in order to obtain optimal results (it depends on the placement & distribution of fat). (Edward P. Miranda, MD, FACS, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Coolsculpting costs</h4><p>The costs of Coolsculpting vary depending upon the areas treated and the number of areas treated. The more areas you treat, the lower the cost per area (usually.) (Jeffrey E. Schreiber, MD, FACS, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting cost in Atlanta</i></p><p>We have Coolsculpting in our Atlanta practice. The fees start at $700 per area for small and medium area, and $1300 for large area. There are discount offered for multiple area. The best way to see if you are a candidate or know how many areas needed is to schedule a consult. (Stanley Okoro, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting Cost – Not all Coolsculpting is Created Equal</strong></p><p>The pricing for Coosculpting is protected by Coolsculpting corporate policy. No one can offer Coolsculpting for more than 25% below the suggested retail pricing provided by Coolsculpting. The actual cost for a Coolsculpting treatment varies from patient to patient depending on the particular needs of the individual and the area requiring treatment.</p><p>You must compare apples to apples and make sure that your provider understands the concept of “treatment to transformation”, meaning that an appropriate number of cycles must be performed to achieve the optimal result. Our practice is a certified Coolsculpting practice and we are all graduates of Coolsculpting University This is important when considering a provider.</p><p>We also combine Coolsculpting with Venus Legacy skin tightening, which will enhance the Coolsculpting result. (Paul Flashner, MD, Boston Physician)</p></div>
