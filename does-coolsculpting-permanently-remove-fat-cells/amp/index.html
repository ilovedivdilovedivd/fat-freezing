<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><strong>Coolsculpting is a permanent result!</strong></p><p>Coolsculpting offers a permanent solution to fat reduction. We typically recommend two treatments performed two months apart for ideal results.</p><p>Proper diet and exercise are necessary to keep an ideal result. (Richard W. Maack, MD, Saint Louis Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>CoolSculpting usually lasts a long time if you keep your weight stable</h5><p>Nothing is permanent but fat reduction techniques are pretty close to permanent if you keep weight down and continue to diet and exercise.</p><p>The good news is that CoolSculpting is an excellent option for unwanted fat and does a great job over time! (Joel Schlessinger, MD, Omaha Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Coolsculpting is permanent fat reduction.</i></p><p>The Coolsculpting procedure results technically should be permanent. In fact, most of our patients see a reduction of anywhere from 20 – 30 % in the area. Of course, patients may gain weight, but it may be dispersed in another area of their body.</p><p>For the stomach area, if you truly have that squeezable fat, you are most likely a good candidate for CoolSculpting, unless what you’re squeezing is mostly skin. If the belly area is harder – you may have visceral fat underneath your abdominal muscle that is not corrected with cosmetic procedures, but strictly your diet.</p><p>In our center, we have three machines and 4 well-trained CoolSculpting technicians who can evaluate whether you’re a good candidate for this non-invasive fat reduction method or whether a cosmetic procedure such as liposuction or tummy tuck is better suited. (Brian Hass, MD, Palm Beach Gardens Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting Results Are Permanent with Stable Weight</i></p><p>If you maintain your weight, your CoolSculpting results with be permanent. If you gain weight after your CoolSculpting procedure, some of the benefit from the procedure will be lost. If you regain a lot of weight, it’s possible that all the benefit will be lost. (Garry K. Kim, MD, Pasadena Internist)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting results</strong></p><p>The great thing about coolsculpting is that it is a permanent procedure. The stomach is an area that is treated often with coolsculpting. The time of the procedure is going to vary. It depends if the facility has multiple machines so they are able to dualsculpt and it will also depend on if they have the newer handpieces or the older ones.</p><p>With the newer handpieces the treatment time per cycle is reduced. I would contact a local provider for a consult. (Renee Burke, MD, Barrington Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>How long does Coolsculpting last</i></p><p>Assuming that you keep a steady weight and a healthy diet, the results from Coolsculping are permanent. The fat cells are frozen and removed from the body. Depending on the area of the body you are trying to treat, and the amount of fat you need to remove, the number of treatments needed ranges between 1-3.</p><p>The abdomen is a great area to have this procedure performed. (Josh Waltzman, MD, MBA, Long Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Frozen fat cells go away … Forever</em></p><p>Coolsculpting works by controlled cooling of the adipocytes whereby your own body’s immune system targets the damaged cells for permanent removal. I find best results require two cycles of treatment in a given location. It should be noted that even though fat cells are lost in this process, the body’s leptin hormonal system continues to regulate overall body weight, so coolsculpting is best for your “trouble spots” that do not respond to diet or exercise.</p><p>Overeating will continue to cause enlargement of residual adipocytes and make your results appear to go away. (Michael H. Swann, MD, Springfield Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>How Long Does Coolsculpting Last?</h4><p>Cool sculpting works by selectively freezing fat cells which are destroyed and gradually removed by the body over the next several weeks to months. We do not make more fat cells so the results are permanent.</p><p>However, it is still possible to gain or lose weight in areas treated by cool sculpting since fat cells remain. The aesthetic results are really dependent upon you and how you take care of yourself after the treatment sessions.</p><p>See a board certified plastic surgeon for a consultation and treatment plan. (Richard Chaffoo, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>CoolSculpting results can be permanent!</h4><p>CoolSculpting results are permanent because the process of freezing the fat results in cryolipolysis – fat cells are broken down permanently. We are born with a fixed amount of fat cells in the body. Weight gain occurs with hypertrophy (expansion) of the existing fat cells, not growth of new fat cells.</p><p>It is for this reason that if you maintain your weight after CoolSculpting, your results will be permanent. CoolSculpting typically requires on average 4 treatment cycles per body area which can take anywhere from 2 to 4 hours depending on how many machines your provider has running at the same time.</p><p>(also known as dual sculpting, when two machines run simultaneously). This can be done all in one day or more commonly over two days. A second treatment is often recommended at one month. You will begin to see results after 3 to 4 weeks with final results at 3 months. (Ran Y. Rubinstein, MD, Manhattan Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Each session with an applicator lasts for one hour. Most patients require two or more sessions. There is an approximately 25% reduction of fat cells in the area treated each session. That reduction in fat cells is permanent.</p><p>Additional reduction in fat cells can be achieved with additional Coolsculpting sessions to the previously treated area. However, remaining fat cells can enlarge with future weight can. The number of sessions needed to achieve the best shape change will be determined at your consultation. (Thomas E. Kaniff, MD, FACS, Sacramento Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>CoolSculpting Results are PERMANENT</h3><p>Results are permanent. With little exception the human body does not develop any new adipocytes (fat cells) after about age 17. CoolSculpting gently cools the skin to a temperature just above freezing and it causes the fat cells to rupture and dissolve away.</p><p>This dissolution process starts immediately after the treatment. Patients report a noticeable reduction in unwanted fat usually starting at about week 2 to 3 with a maximizing the dissolution of the unwanted fat somewhere between months two and three.</p><p>The procedure takes about one hour. In our practice and we have performed over 500 treatments we see that patients report a significant and satisfying in unwanted fat in 80 to 85% of cases. I would say in the successful cases 2 of 3 patients need only one treatment.</p><p>About one third of these patients will elect to have a second or 3rd treatment at the 2-6 month point. (Charles E. Crutchfield III, MD, Minneapolis Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Zeltiq-Coolsculpting</em></p><p>The fat loss from a single 1-hour procedure is about 22-23% ranging up to 40%. These fat cells are destroyed in a process called cryolipolysis (cryo-cold lipo-fat lysis-destroy) and therefore permanent (this presumes that one has a healthy diet.). (Jon E. Mendelsohn, MD, Cincinnati Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Cool sculpting Procedure Details?</em></p><p>Cool sculpting is an effective procedure using “freezing” technology that permanently removes fat cells. Patients can expect about a 20% reduction after a procedure that lasts approximately one hour. The procedure can be repeated on the same area in a few months. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Cool sculpting is the only device that is FDA approved for permanent fat reduction that is non-invasive! I always tell patients that the number of treatments you will need is determined by how much fat you have which your doctor can help you decide when they measure you.</p><p>Just remember that each treatment has been shown to get rid of 20-25% of the fat in the area permanently. (Grace Liu, MD, Newport Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting for Permanent Results</i></p><p>CoolSculpting permanently removes approximately 25 percent of the fat in the treated area. The procedure takes about one hour and does not require anesthesia. Depending in the desired post-op result some patients may elect to have a second or a third procedure.</p><p>With each procedure, an additional 25 percent of fat has been reported to be removed. (Carlin Vickery, MD (retired), New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Permanent reults and one hour per area</h4><p>It has been our experience that our patients are seeing results as significant as two to three inches when they have done abdomen and flanks. Between 21 to 25 % of the fat cells are destroyed through apoptosis.</p><p>Even with weight gain we have seen the treated areas remain relatively smaller than the untreated areas. (Stephen A. Brown, MD, Hartford Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
