<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>It does work – clinical studies and practical experience show that it does work.</p><p>Now, being practical, it will not remove all of your fat and you may need more than one session to achieve the desired result. (Michael Gold, MD, Nashville Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Does Coolsculpting Really Work?</h3><p>Absolutely Yes. You can expect the treated layer of fat to be reduced 20-25%. It takes 2-3 months to see the final result. You can treat a second or even a third time if you wish.</p><p>This is a great alternative to liposuction which requires time to recover and carries a much greater potential for risks and complications. (Janet Woodyard, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Zeltiq (CoolSculpting) permanently reduces thefat inthe area that is treated.</h4><p>CoolSculpting has been extensively studied and is effective is reducing the fat lyer that is treated by 20-25%. We have been very pleased with the results of CoolSculpting because it permamently reduces the fat in the treated area.</p><p>As all fat reducing procedures, it is not a substitute for diet and exercise. It is most effective to spot treat diet and exercise resisitant fat bulges in and around the waistline and flank. (Laurie A. Casas, MD, FACS, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i> zeltiq coolsculpting really does work for fat reduction….</i></p><p>coolsculpting is very effective at reduction fat pockets that are resistant to diet and exercise and is ideal for people close to their ideal body weight. It is not a weight reduction procedure but instead a sculpting procedure.</p><p>People who are overweight or obese are not good candidates. (Louise Ferland, MD, Richmond Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Zeltiq Coolsculpting works for Fat Reduction</i></p><p>The medical community has been waiting for a fat reduction treatment like Zeltiq for a long time. Benefits: No surgical incisions or anesthesia is required and the procedure involves few side effects and virtually no recovery or downtime.</p><p>One treatment per area is all it takes to see 20-25% fat reduction, unlike other fat reduction devices that require multiple clinic visits for the same treatment area. And best of all, the treatment affects fat stem cells, so improvement is permanent.</p><p>If you gain weight, it will likely not go to the Zeltiq-treated area. Limitations: The process takes 1 hour to treat each area. So both love handles and the lower abdomen will require 3 hours to complete.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_160" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You will be seated and able to read or sleep while the procedure is performed. It also takes patience to see the results. Because the fat cell degradation and excretion process is very natural, it takes 2 months to see the results.</p><p>The other important limitation is that it is not for every body type. You should be within 30-40 lbs of your ideal body weight to be a good candidate. Any more than that and you may want to look at liposuction techniques or a more intensive exercise/diet regimen.</p><p>Zeltiq is perfect for trouble spots and diet and exercise resistant fat bulges (the so-called muffin tops and love handles). (Narin (Joe) Apisarnthanarax, MD, Houston Dermatologist)</p><h4>CoolSculpting by Zeltiq works but patient selection is key</h4><p>Patient selection for CoolSculpting is key. The ideal patient is near goal weight, physically fit, exercises, eats a healthy diet and still has stubborn areas that bother them. CoolSculpting is not a substitute for weight loss, larger volume liposuction or a tummy tuck and when used in these situations disappointment will likely follow.</p><p>That being said, in a good candidate, CoolSculpting™ uses controlled cooling (Cryolysis) to bring the targeted fat cells to just above freezing without harming the overlying skin. Within a few weeks your body’s natural healing process then removes the damaged fat cells, resulting in safe, gradual fat reduction.</p><p>On average, each CoolSculpting™ procedure results in a 20% reduction of fat in the treated area, and patients can start to enjoy a toned, slimmer look three weeks following treatment, with the most dramatic results occurring over a period of two to three months. (Lawrence W. Shaw, MD, Arizona Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_162" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p><b>CoolSculpting can provide wonderful results in fat reduction for some people</b></p><p>In the right candidate, CoolSculpting has provided significant fat reduction without surgery. It can be repeated in two months for futher improvement. It is especially a great treatment for those who are not surgical candidates because of medical health issues or those who refuse to undergo surgery, or those who want minimal down time. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Zeltiq permanently reduces fat without downtime</strong></p><p>Zeltiq is a noninvasive way to permanently reduce fat. It is best used in patients that are relatively fit, but have small pockets of diet and exercise-resistant fat. Patients can expect a 20-25% reduction of the area that is treated.</p><p>During and after the 1 hour treatment, you may some discomfort, but you are able to resume normal activities. The body slowly breaks down the fat over the next 2-4 months. (Melissa Chiang, MD, FAAD, Houston Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>Does Coolsculpting Work?</h5><p>This is an FDA-cleared machine….it has gone through testing and trials with promising results. The literature and the patient testimonials are consistent that there is a 20-25% reduction of fat in the area treated with each treatment.</p><p>The BEST thing is that there is NO DOWN TIME and the patient can go back to work, school, and their normal activity immediately after getting the treatment. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>We have seen great results!</b></p><p>We have seen great results in our practice with Cool Sculpting. Scientific documentation shows a reduction of 20-25% for one treatment and we are showing the same results with patients being treated in our office.</p><p>Although Coolsculpting is not a trade off for Liposuction it is a great non surgical option for fat reduction. (Renato Saltz, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>i have been waiting to be able to offer a technology like this. most of the competing technologies either work minimally or require multiple treatments to see much effect. coolsculpting has been shown by ultrasound to decrease the thickness of the fatty layer by about 20%. (Eric Chang, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Does Zeltiq (CoolSculpting) Really Work for Fat Reduction…</strong></p><p>Cool Sculpting is a new innovative fat loss procedure that is widely spreading because of its outstanding outcome. Its completely non-invasive and nearly painless. There is no anesthesia involved or any numbing needed whatsoever. The suction tool is left on the fatty region for one hour, massaged down for a few minutes and the patient is on their way! Cool Sculpting shows results between eight to ten weeks after the procedure and continues to diminish fat cells after that.</p><p>Repeated treatments can yield additional improvement. (Shain A. Cuber, MD, Edison Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Does Zeltiq (CoolSculpting) Really Work for Fat Reduction?</strong></p><p>Yes, Coolsculpting does work! Patients need to be seen and evaluated but if you are deemed a good candidate, you can anticipate seeing results. (Kathleen Waldorf, MD, FACS, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In my practice we have been very pleased with the results that we’ve seen from CoolSculpting and in fact, even some patients that come in for a liposuction consultation are treated instead with this non-invasive procedure with great results.</p><p>We have now performed over 450 treatments and the vast majority of the patients treated have been very pleased. (Adam David Lowenstein, MD, FACS, Santa Barbara Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting Works to Reduce Unwanted Fat</i></p><p>We confidently promote this treatment to patients as the science and research behind CoolSculpting by Zeltiq is so solid, as well as the consistent results acknowledged by many physicians and patients the past few years.</p><p>Just as promoted, each single treatment will reduce the fatty layer 20-25%. This is a recognizable difference and can be seen in photos and confirmed by the patients having treatment. To meet patient expectations and obtain very satisfying results in the amount of reduction, we most commonly recommend 2-3 treatments for our patients (particularly in the abdomen, torso).</p><p>Each CoolSculpting treatment will effectively reduce the fatty layer 20-25% and we know that our patients are looking for results that ultimately provide significant physical changes in appearance and a desire to fit clothing better.</p><p>If you’re looking for a non-surgical approach to reduce unwanted fat, CoolSculpting is the most reliable and exciting treatment option offered. (Gregory Mesna, MD, FACS, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Coolsculpting really works!</h5><p>Coolsculpting is a great way to remove exercise-resistant fat from the abdomen, love handles, and back. The fat is frozen and is then eliminated from you body. (Jeffrey E. Schreiber, MD, FACS, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>CoolSculpting works for targeting fat</b></p><p>CoolSculpting definitely works for small areas of exercise-resistant fat. Patients with larger pockets of fat may not be suitable candidates for this procedure. CoolSculpting works by topically freezing fat beyond its ability to survive. Slowly over the months after the treatment, the fat is metabolized the body naturally with up to 25% fat reduction.</p><p>Full results are seen 4 to 6 months after the procedure. Most patients are seeing the most positive results with about two procedures per area. (Daniel Shapiro, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting Works Best for Patients with Small Pockets of Fat</em></p><p>CoolSculpting works for small areas of exercise-resistant fat. Individuals with larger pockets of fat may not be suitable candidates for this procedure. CoolSculpting works by topically freezing fat beyond its ability to survive. Slowly over the months after the treatment, the fat is absorbed by the body naturally with up to 20-40% fat reduction.</p><p>Full results are seen 4 to 6 months after the procedure, and many patients only need one treatment to see noticeable results. (D. Scott Karempelis, MD, Atlanta Dermatologic Surgeon)</p></div>
