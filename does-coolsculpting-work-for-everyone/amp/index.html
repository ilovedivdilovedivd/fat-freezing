<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><i>Cool Sculpting works</i></p><p>Cool sculpting definitely works. It works best on stubborn fat deposits that are pinchable and this indicates that it will be isolated by the treatment panel. Visit with a board certified plastic surgeon experienced in body contouring to guide you in the best treatment options.</p><p>Not everyone is best served with Coolsculpting as the only option. Many of my patients are better candidates for liposuction or tummy tuck. It is very important to me and my office staff that we guide patients to the most effective treatment for each patient.</p><p>Find a specialist that you can communicate with and offer you the best solution to your needs. (Steven M. Camp, MD, Fort Worth Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Effectiveness time between procedures</h3><p>The science is amazing and patients are getting real results without having and invasive procedure like liposuction. Fat lipolysis sounds complicated but simply means to kill fat cells. The area treated with the coolsculpting applicator 25% of the fat cells die within 3 days! You have to be realistic in your goal, coosculpting is not for everyone, but the science is there when the fat cells are frozen a process of fat lipolysis occurs.</p><p>The only way this can be screwed up is if your diet disrespects your investment. (Rosalind Jackson, MD, Miamisburg OB-GYN)</p><p><strong>Yes, CoolSculpting does work! But not for everyone!</strong></p><p>This is one of the most popular questions we get asked about CoolSculpting…does it really work. Yes it really works. CoolSculpting is an FDA cleared non-invasive fat reduction procedure and has been studied in more than 5,500 in clinical trail patients and has been performed over 4 million times worldwide.</p><p>CoolSculpting had been proven to reduce fat by up to 25% in the appropriate treatment area. We always recommend that you receive a in person consultation with an experienced CoolSculpting provider to determine if you are a candidate for the procedure. (Timothy Zelko, DO, Westmont Physician)</p><p>Yes, Coolsculpting definitely works as long as the applicators are applied correctly. You can expect about 20% reduction of the fat in the treatment area. Usually a second treatment can be done around 3 months later. (William Kwan, MD, FAAD, San Francisco Dermatologist)</p><h5>Results from CoolSculpting treatments</h5><p>The CoolSculpting procedure has been tested through research and peer-review clinical papers that testify to its efficacy and safety. It is the only FDA-cleared, non-surgical fat-reduction treatment that uses cooling to target stubborn areas of fat.</p><p>Fat cells are crystallised, die and are then naturally eliminated from the body. Once they are gone, they are gone for good! You should typically expect to see results from 3 – 8 weeks following treatment, so we generally advise you not having further treatments on the same areas until the initial treatment has had enough time to work effectively. (Tracy Mountford, MBBS, London Physician)</p><p><strong>Yes, however patient selection is critical for Coolsculpting and body contouring. </strong></p><p>Coolsculpting does really work. The results will vary for each individual and in a small percentage a clients experience a minor to nil result. Patient selection for Coolsculpting is one of the most important steps.</p><p>This treatment should not be used as a alternative to weight loss, it is a body contouring treatment. Body contouring is used to target areas on the body that may contain peaks and bulges that appear out of proportion to the rest of the body and no matter what size or weight you are will remain this way.</p><p>Also having realistic expectations on what one session will achieve and knowing that multiple session may be required is key. Results can be seen as early as 4 weeks but it is idea to wait 8-12 weeks for the full fat cell elimination to occur.</p><p>Our protocol is to wait 8-12 weeks between sessions as some patients my require only one session to obtain their goals, others a few more. (Davin Lim, MBBS, FACD, Brisbane Dermatologist)</p><p><em>Does CoolSculpting work</em></p><p>Yes in appropriate candidates it works very well. Your BMI should be 30 or below. You will need to maintain your weight.</p><p>If you over eat the extra calories will enlarge your remaining fat cells and decrease your results. (Maurice M. Vick, Jr., MD, Baton Rouge Urologist)</p><h3>Does CoolSculpting really work?</h3><p>Yes, it really works. As a high volume provider of CoolSculpting treatments, we find selecting the right patient is the best way to get a great result. Patients who have fat that is resistant to diet and exercise seem to do the best though even those who diet and exercise occasionally have had good results.</p><p>Seeing a coolsculpting provider who has performed at least a thousand procedures and has also been trained by CoolSculpting University is the best place to start so you can get a full treatment plan to give you the most contoured appearance. (Mike Majmundar, MD, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting is safe and effective </strong></p><p>CoolSculpting has been approved by the FDA for fat reduction. This means that the parent company, Zeltiq, has submitted scientific evidence that proves the efficacy of the procedure. In my experience, it works VERY WELL for the right patient, not for everyone.</p><p>Not all patients are good CoolSculpt candidates. Some don’t have enough fat and some have too much. A personalized consultation will help you determine if this procedure is right for you. (Julie A. Maughan, MD, Ogden Dermatologist)</p><p>Coolsculpting is FDA approved and has been proven to reduce fat by 25% in appropriate treatment areas. Fat treated with Coolsculpting must be easily “pinchable”.</p><p>Depending on the treatment plan, treatments can be done back to back, or a waiting period may be recommended to determine if and where additional treatment cycles would be placed.</p><p>To ensure you get the best results with Coolsculpting it is important to have your treatment completed with an experienced provider. (Thomas E. Kaniff, MD, FACS, Sacramento Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting Really Does Work</i></p><p>The key to success is having a comprehensive evaluation by a well-trained practitioner who has trained through the CoolSculpt University and understands each applicator and it’s appropriate area of use. The placement of each applicator and amount of overlap of the applicators and number of cycles to optimize results is what can lead to smooth “liposuction” results.</p><p>We understand a lot more now than we did when the device first came out. There have been significant advancements in the types and shapes of applicators. Using the wrong applicator for an area can lead to “shark bites”.</p><p>The comprehensive evaluation and consultation should include the number of anticipated cycles per area and the cost of “treatment to transfirmation”. (John Grasso, MD, Upland Physician)</p></div>
