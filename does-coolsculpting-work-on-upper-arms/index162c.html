<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><strong>CoolSculpting for reduction of fat of the upper arms</strong></p><p>Coolsculpting of the upper outer arms has been done for years with good results by physicians as an off-label procedure.</p><p>The curved applicators have been used, but also with the development of the CoolFit applicator, which is flat, many physicians have been able to use this with good results on their patients.</p><p>Sometimes there is a numbness of the forearm that can develop temporarily. I am not aware of these cases having become permanent.</p><p>Other cases can be treated by liposuction or ThermiTight. Both of the latter two treatments reduce fat.</p><p>If a patient has loose crepy sagging skin, then an arm lift might be indicated, but many object to the scar that results from this surgical procedure, whether it is the scar that lies lengthwise along the back of the arm, or the scar that initially hides in the underarm, but may spread over time.

</div><p>CoolSculpting can be done on the upper arms with good results in the appropriate candidates. However, not everyone is a suitable candidate for the treatment and often a minimum of 2 rounds is needed for optimal results.</p><p>Find a physician who has experience in treating the arms. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><p><em>Coolsculpting and arms</em></p><p>Coolsculpting and the arms works very well. You need to find someone very experienced with this technique to get the best results. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p>CoolSculpting can be used to treat fat on the upper arms, but it is considered an off-label use because it is not FDA approved for that specific location.</p><p>I have seen good results in patients treated on the upper arms.

</div><h3>CoolSculpting on arms with loose skin</h3><p>CoolScuplting will reduce the amount of fullness from fat, and I do see it somewhat tigthen skin. However, if you have a lot of loose, hanging skin, you may not be happy with your results from any nonsurgical intervention.</p><p>CoolSculpting will be right for you if you would be happy with smaller arms that still have hanging skin. If what you want is a smooth, thin, tight arm, then you’ll need an arm lift. (Carmen Kavali, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Does CoolSculpting work on The Upper Arms?</em></p><p>And the answer is a resounding, YES! Of course it does depend on the individual client and the amount of volume they have in this area.</p><p>Our results have been truly stunning when using CoolSculpting on the upper arms.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3900" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>The best results are always found in areas where the fat being treated is more jiggly and fluffy. Most patients who are interested in treating this area, have exactly this type of fat, and it really gets dramatic results.</p><p>The new CoolAdvantage applicators only take 35 minutes to do this treatment, and it is more comfortable than ever. I think it is just incredible that something non-invasive, like Coolsculpting can now give such astonishing results in a small amount of treatment time. (Edward Stokes, MD, West Hollywood Physician)</p><h4>CoolSculpting for Flabby Arm Fat</h4><p>CoolSculpting by Zeltiq is FDA approved for fat reduction of the belly and love handles. It can, however be used off label for areas such as the arms, back, bra fat, inner thighs, etc. As far as the arms go, the flabbiness can be caused either by fat, loose skin, or loose muscle.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3901" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>If your flabby arms are because of excess arm fat then CoolSculpting can be used to treat the area. The results of CoolSculpting to the arms is not as drastic as the abdomen or love handles, but it can provide a nice contour to the shape of your arms.</p><p>It’s important that you get a CoolSculpting consultation from someone experienced in treating the arms to see if you are a candidate. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><h3>CoolSculpting for Arms. Skin Laxity solutions for the face and neck.</h3><p>Unfortunately, there are no reliable and reproducible lasers, lights, injectables nor other options other than skin excision / reduction to remove lax, hanging extra skin of the body, arms, legs or face.</p><p>Muscle building will fill the volume of the skin laxity but exercise will not tighten skin. There are improving exceptions to this rule.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3902" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>T hese include: retinoids and Sculptra for facial firming, CoolSculpting (CS), while not promised has seen some skin shrinking in the lower abdomen and back folds in some patients. Our experience with CS for arms has been excellent.</p><p>Patients are pleased with the reduction (although limited) and skin shrinking (not tightening) of the hanging skin bulge. Their clothes fit better which fulfilled their desires and expectations. Regarding skin and soft-tissue laxity of the face and neck, “if you can pinch an inch” of skin along the jawline in front of the earlobe, no amount of fillers, Botox, lasers and promises will shrink the skin; you will need a face and / or neck lift to remove skin laxity.</p><p>In all cases, consult with a Board Certified well experienced Plastic Surgeon or ENT Facial surgeon who will properly examine you and offer his best recommendations for YOU! (Dean P. Kane, MD, FACS, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting for Hanging Arm Skin</strong></p><p>I do a lot of arm treatments with CoolSculpting and it can work very well for the right candidates. You would need an in-person evaluation to see whether the treatment would be appropriate for you.</p><p>Generally speaking, if your main issue is loose skin then you won’t get much of a benefit from CoolSculpting. If you are exploring non-surgical options, then ThermiTight would be a much better treatment for this. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting works extremely well to reduce fat. On the arms, this may not give the result you are looking for. “Flabby arms” can often be the result of skin laxity in addition to excess fat.</p><p>This can be addressed with a heat based technique such as Velashape. The two techniques can also be combined for optimal results. (Todd C. Becker, MD, PhD, Boulder Dermatologist)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3904" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><h5>CoolSculpting for upper arm and back/bra fat</h5><p>CoolSculpting can be used to treat excess fat on the upper arms and the bra/back fat area. However, these treatments cannot be done with just one applicator. The arm and bra/back area would need to be treated as separate locations. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>CoolSculpting Arms And Bra Fat</h5><p>Both areas are treatable with CoolSculpting, but will need separate applicators. FYI, CoolSculpting was just FDA approved for treatment of Bra Fat. The cost for treating those areas will probably still be cheaper than the quote you were given for laser lipo. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><p>We have used CoolScupting to treat the upper arm as well as the bra fat. the treatment can be done at the same time, but each area will require its own CoolScupting cup treatment. (Reza Momeni, MD FACS, Summit Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3905" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Coolsculpting would address both of these areas with two treatments. You would require one for the bra fat and one for the arms. This would be a great non-invasive method to treat these areas and would not cause loose skin. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p>Coolsculpting is a great option for those patients who have fat that is pinchable in areas such as abdomen, back, bra roll areas, and thighs.</p><p>As far as I am aware I don’t think FDA has approved Coolsculpting for the arms. So if you were to have a Coolsculpting for the arms it would be an off label use. From what you have described it appears that you are more of a surgical candidate than Coolsculpting.</p><p>Therefore I would recommend for you to have a consultation and examination by board-certified plastic surgeon. (Himansu Shah, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3906" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d11181e0e3019f692419954555988c59">

</div><h5>CoolSculpting can often tighten skin</h5><p>It is great that you are keeping fit, and frustrating to struggle with an area like the back of your arms. While not FDA approved for tightening skin, I and many of my plastic surgeon colleagues have seen skin tone improve with CoolSculpting.</p><p>I can’t say without seeing you in person whether or not that amount of tightening would be enough to address your concerns. Many of my patients are very happy with moderate improvement in loose skin instead of full improvement that comes with the scars of formal surgical arm lifts.</p><p>If you have a consult with a surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery, you can learn about all the treatment options available, surgical and non surgical (and for faces too, BTW). (Elizabeth Slass Lee, MD, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>How fast for results after Coolsculpting?</em></p><p>In most of my patients we are seeing results as early as 4 weeks. I would be patient and suggest that some people may not see the beginning of the change for 6-8 weeks. (Steven Hacker, MD, West Palm Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Some patients can start noticing results as early as 4 weeks. It can vary depending the area and on the individual. Results can take up to 8-12 weeks, so just give it some time. Initially the area can be swollen as well, so the results won’t be noticeable early on. (Steven H. Williams, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I would generally say that this is an area where surgery can consistently outperform Coolsculpting. For the right individual with great skin tone and some mild/moderate amount of fatty deposit, Coolsculpting is a great option.</p><p>But if you have even mild/moderate skin laxity, then an arm lift might be needed to get you the result you are looking for. (Young R. Cho, MD, PhD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Arms may take longer and not respond as well as love handles with CoolSculpting by Zeltiq</h4><p>We don’t yet have an arm applicator but if the fat pad is such that one of the current three applicators fits well enough than we have performed Zeltiq’s CoolSculpting with good results.</p><p>Newer applicators are forthcoming. There is quite a bit of gravity that makes the skin of the upper outer arm hang down and it may take months to see the tightening and new collagen deposition that will occur after CoolSculpting.
