<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Coolsculpting is a great, non-invasive procedure that would help minimize the fat in the “love handle” region.</p><p>It would contour the area and decrease the “squareish” appearance of your backside. There is little to no downtime, and the procedure itself takes about an hour for each side. Kybella would not be appropriate for this type of problem. (Mariam Cappiello, MD, Chestnut Hill Anesthesiologist)</p><p>Liposuction is very invasive and may be unnecessary in case with no up side. Coolsculpting really works but it is not a weight loss device. It is designed for patients who have achieved their ideal weight and cannot get rid of their bulge in their abdomen or love handles.</p><p>A consultation by an experienced dermatologist is necessary. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p><b>Coolsculpting is great for the love handles</b></p><p>For exercise-resistant fat, Coolsculpting is a great non-surgical alternative to standard liposuction. (Jeffrey E. Schreiber, MD, FACS, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Surgical removal of fat that is needed for normal function or in areas that are thin, could create irregularities of the surface that are cosmetically unsatisfactory and can even interfere with the circulation of blood flow to the skin.</p><p>CoolSculpting should not pose these risks but might not have to be done either if there is not enough fat to warrant the procedure and cost. Please see a physician in consultation who is experienced with CoolSculpting to see if you are a candidate. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Non-Surgical vs Surgical for love handles</h4><p>CoolSculpting may be a possible treatment to contour your waist to make it more defined. If there is not enough fat to suction then you would be more of a candidate for liposuction. It’s best to have a consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon that can give you both surgical and non-surgical options! (Robert G. Aycock, MD, FACS, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>What is the best fat removal procedure for love handles?</b></p><p>It really depends what your desired side effect profile is. If you want the best result possible, then I would suggest liposuction. If you want to minimize your downtime, then I would suggest choosing Coolsculpting.</p><p>Coolsculpting is a little less reliable and it only removes about 20% of the fat layer per session. Liposuction can remove 80 to 90% more consistently and reliably in experienced hands. Of course, you should seek a surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. (Thomas McFadden, MD, Greenville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting is a great choice if you’re looking for an effective treatment that will permanently eliminate fat from your body using a non-surgical approach. Each treatment area requires 35 minutes, and 4 weeks for initial results to become visible. 12 weeks for optimal results. (Philip Solomon, MD, FRCS, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>CoolSculpting vs. Liposuction</h4><p>CoolSculpting results are not the same as liposuction results. CoolSculpting reduces the fat in the area treated by 20-25% per treatment. Liposuction may give a larger reduction. The difference is that CoolSculpting is non-invasive and no recovery time (usually less expensive) and so it really depends on what the patient is wanting to achieve. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting works great but is not a replacement for Liposuction</strong></p><p>Coolscultping works excellent to reduce unwanted fat bulges on the body. It typically reduces on average 22-25% of fat layer with one one hour treatment. However, this is not as dramatic as liposuction and is not a substitute for liposuction.</p><p>The advantage of Coolsculpting is it’s safety profile as there is no invasive surgery. (Steven Hacker, MD, West Palm Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Remove love handles noninvasively</em></p><p>It is very easy to remove love handles using the Coolsculpting device. Other devices which work as well are the Vanquish and Sculpsure. These devices give permanent fat removal with no downtime. Cooladvantage and Z wave give faster and better results. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Freeze away stubborn fat deposits</h4><p>Coolsculpting is a good fit for someone like yourself who has fat deposits resistant to exercise & healthy diet. During your consultation, templates of the applicators will be held up against your love handles to choose which one(s) should be placed, and you will get an estimate of the time & cost.</p><p>If multiple machines are available, both sides may be able to be done anywhere from 35-60 minutes of treatment time. Your exam will reveal how many sessions (spaced 3 months apart) will be needed. (Vaishali B. Doolabh, MD, FACS, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Cool sculpting for love handles</h5><p>CoolScultping generally will yield about a 20-25% improvement with one treatment session.</p><p>This can be repeated for further improvement after about th three months . I recommend a consultation with a Board -certified plastic surgeon to decide whether a surgical or non-surgical would be optimal for your goals and for your anatomy. (Michael H. Wojtanowski, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Liposuction is more effective for one treatment than CoolSculpting for love handles</h3><p>There is no doubt that liposuction removes more fat cells in one treatment than the amount of fat cells that are destroyed in one treatment, and even a few, with Zeltiq’s CoolSculpting. Liposuction involves local anesthetic, and some other medicaton often, to help you relax and there are surgical risks, although it is a very safe procedure when done according to the standard appraoach.</p><p>Zeltiq has virtually no down time. You can go out to dinner that night, and often, with your doctor’s permission, resume strenuous activity within a day or two but there can be brusiing and swelling temporarily, and much less than liposuction usually.</p><p>There are no small insertion sites that need to heal with Zeltiq. CoolSculpting can be repeated every couple of months but the time it takes to have a considerable improvement is longer than that from liposuction. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>Liposuction or Cool sculpting (Zeltiq)?</h5><p>Liposuction surgery involves incisions and an invasive procedure to directly remove adipose tissue. Some form of anesthesia is necessary. The procedure is effective with approximately 60 to 80% of adipose tissue removed from the treated area. Like any surgical procedure some recovery time (time off work etc.) it is necessary.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3148" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>It generally takes several months after the procedure to see the end results. However, cool sculpting is a noninvasive ( with no downtime) technique of removal of isolated adipose tissue that results in 20-25% reduction of the fat in the area treated.</p><p>Repeated treatments may be necessary/ helpful. For example, if a patient presents as a good candidate for liposuction surgery ( diet and exercise resistant adipose tissue with overlying good-quality skin elasticity), then liposuction surgery is probably the best way to go if the patient is interested in a single procedure.</p><p>If the patient presents with isolated adipose tissue “pocket” and is interested in a noninvasive procedure(s) with no downtime ( but with less effect) then cool sculpting may be an option. As always, direct physical examination is necessary to determine if the patient is a candidate for any modality of treatment. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting for stubborn areas</strong></p><p>Coolsculpting for stubborn areas is ideal. The procedure is really fantastic for people at or near their goal weight that just have a few stubborn, distinct spots that don’t want to budge despite your best efforts. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting and Liposuction: Both Great for Different Purposes</strong></p><p>When it comes to choosing a method for fat reduction, the amount of unwanted fat a patient desires to remove is a major consideration. Coolsculpting® is great for very small amounts of undesired, diet- and exercise- resistant fat.</p><p>Liposuction works better on more substantial amounts of fat. However, there are many additional factors to consider like results and recovery. While Coolsculpting® is non-invasive and doesn’t require down time, two treatments are necessary for optimal results, which will be evident after 4 to 6 months.</p><p>Coolsculpting® applies extreme cold to the target area, which causes the body to respond by eliminating the fat within fat cells over time. Liposuction requires more significant recovery time as it is a surgical procedure, but can produce noticeable results that will be evident immediately after the swelling from surgery goes down.</p><p>Both of these fat reduction techniques, however, can be used to treat love handles. (Edmond Griffin, MD, Atlanta Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Fat reduction without liposuction</b></p><p>It is not uncommon to have stubborn areas of fatty tissue despite strict diet and exercise. For these areas, there are several options including surgical and nonsurgical. One great nonsurgical option is Coolsculpting which can decrease the amount of fatty tissue by 20-25% in each treated area. (Nicholas Tarola, MD, Nashville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Better Results for Love Handles, Coolsculpting or Liposuction?</em></p><p>Liposuction and Coolsculpting can both sculpt and improve the appearance of the love handles. In general, liposuction can remove a significantly greater amount of fat (eg. 60%) compared to Coolsculpting (eg. 20%). Liposuction is a minimally invasive outpatient procedure that can be performed under local anesthesia and has a short recovery time.</p><p>Coolsculpting is a noninvasive procedure that does not require any downtime. The results, however, are much more modest than liposuction. Overall, for those patients seeking the best contouring result, liposuction remains the gold standard. On the other hand, for patients who are willing to accept a much more modest improvement and do not wish to undergo a minor procedure, Coolsculpting may be an appropriate treatment option.</p><p>I would seek the counsel of a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon for more information and an evaluation. (Larry Fan, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting vs Liposuction for love handles</em></p><p>Liposuction is a surgical procedure that requires local or iv anesthesia. There is more downtime due to the more invasive nature of this procedure. Patients have to wear compression garments for several weeks and exercise is prohibited for an amount of time following the procedure.</p><p>If a patient has very large amounts of fat and wants to undergo a single procedure, liposuction is likely the best choice. Cool Sculpting is a non-invasive. non-surgical procedure that is ideal for smaller areas of exercise resistant fat.</p><p>There is no down time and no anesthesia required. Each treatment results in a 20% reduction of fat. Some patients may require more than one treatment and individual results may very. If a patient is unable to undergo a surgical procedure for medical reasons, Cool Sculpting may be a great alternative to surgery. (Lori Stetler, MD, Dallas Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>Coolsculpting results can be very disappointing.</h5><p>Our impression is that patient expectations are not often met because this technique removes only small amounts of fat. Liposuction of the love handles does require some anesthesia,and a few days of recovery, but the results are dramatic. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
