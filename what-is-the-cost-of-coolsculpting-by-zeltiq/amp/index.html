<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h3>Price of Coolsculpting by Zeltiq</h3><p>Zeltiq costs $750 to $1500 per treatment depending on the area and the size of the applicator.</p><p>If you only have a small area on the stomach, then it is $750. If your abdomen needs the larger adaptor then the price is $1500.</p><p>Love handles, back fat, buttock areas, are all $750 per side. With the new Cool-Advantage adaptors the procedures in most areas take only 35 minutes.</p><p>There is a special adaptor for the neck called the Cool-mini which takes one hour and there are special adaptors for the inner and outer thighs as well.</p><p>The Cool-mini takes under one hour and costs $1,000 for the area. It is a great safe procedure and my patients have been thrilled with the results. Most of my patients have returned to do other areas because they were so happy with the results.</p><p>When treating multiple areas many physicians will offer discounts. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p><em>The Cost of Coolsculpting</em></p><p>The cost of Coolsculpting can vary from person to person. The typical cost of a cycle is $750 and is highly protected by Zeltiq. What does this mean to you? I can say that the cost per cycle will be very consistent across the board.</p><p>Where the variation occurs is in how many cycles you will need. Are you looking for subtle results or a total transformation? Maybe something in between?</p><p>Many locations do have some savings in place for purchasing multiple cycles, including us at Rejuvenate Austin.</p><p>We currently provide customized treatment packages, while staying within the guidelines provided by Zeltiq. You will definitely save when purchasing multiple cycles. Care Credit financing is a nice option for deferred interest financing of your procedure.</p><p>Consultations are typically complimentary. You should always go to an office that has a doctor on site. (Jessica Wright, MD, Austin General Surgeon)</p><h4>CoolSculpting Pricing</h4><p>CoolSculpting Pricing varies depending upon the individual and what they need done. To truly know the exact cost you must have a consultation with a CoolSculpting Certified Specialist. There is minimum pricing that is set by Zeltiq, but pricing can vary depending on any promotions.</p><p>Also, we provide a concierge program that greatly reduces the prices of other services the day of your Coolsculpting procedure depending on what you are having done. It is very wise to research where you go and make sure they have been thoroughly trained and are a Certified CoolSculpting clinic that has met all the requirements to have that certification. (Leslie Predmore, NMD, Phoenix Physician)</p><p>Here in Marina del Rey, CA, the cost of Zeltiq using the medium applicator costs $750 for one cycle but is as low as 500$ per cycle when 10 cycles are purchased at once. We have a special 4 cycles for 2500$ and can do them in one hour with our 4 machines.</p><p>We also offer the larger treatment applicator which costs $1500 per cycle and is about 2.5 times the size of the regular medium applicator in one hour. All of our patients have been very happy with the results of CoolSculpting.</p><p>I am a happy cool sculpting patient myself. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>How Much Does Coolsculpting by Zeltiq Cost </i></p><p>CoolSculpting ranges from $650 per applicator for the medium size applicator and $1200 per applicator for the large size applicator. The prices decrease significantly if purchased in a package. CoolSculpting is an amazing body sculpting procedure that get rid of fat bulges without no surgery, no anesthesia, and no downtime. (Daniel Taheri, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Zeltiq fat coolsculpting is a great value</i></p><p>In the Dallas Fort Worth metroplex the cost usually runs $750 per area about the size of hotdog. The larger treatment head, which we offer, is a better value if your body will accommodate it which is $1400.</p><p>It treats at about twice the area in just one hour. Our patients have been very happy with their results. This is not an invasive procedure and no major risks involved. (Angela Bowers, MD, Southlake Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of Zeltiq-cool sculpting</h3><p>In the New York area it presently is 700- 950 approximately per small bulge. The larger bulge hand piece is more. Repeat treatment is less . Occasionally specials are offered. This year is our 25 th year anniversary and we will be offering 10% off and many other specials. (Joshua L. Fox, MD, Long Island Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>Low cost way to reduce Fat</h5><p>Zeltiq Fees are far below that of Liposuction or other more conventional way to remove fat. Kepp in mind it reduces about 20-25% of the fat per area in one treament and you can excercise the next day.</p><p>Costs are what you see in the other answers below, generally $650-900 per treatment area (one session), there can be some savings in time and money using the larger head which treats 2.6 times the area for $1200-1500. (Barry E. DiBernardo, MD, Montclair Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The cost of Coolsculpting by Zeltig</h3><p>The cost varies by practice and location and fat bulges being treated. However, it typically ranges from $650 to $1200 depending upon the patient, the applicator device used, and whether or not other areas are treated at the same time. (Steven Hacker, MD, West Palm Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Zeltiq has a standard pricing range for Coolsculpting treatments and all practices do abide by the standard tier pricing schedule. There may be some slight variation based on geographic area and specials that certain practice may run, but generally you will see the pricing is generally the same. (Maiysha Clairborne, MD, Atlanta Family Physician)</p><p><strong>Zeltiq cost is much less than liposuction</strong></p><p>In our practice we have Zeltiq pricing as low as $500/cycle. The number of cycles needed depends on size of the fat rolls and the degree of reduction desired by the individual. (Sam Naficy, MD, FACS, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Cool Sculpting Costs in Atlanta</em></p><p>The cost of fat reduction depends on how much fat you want to lose! It also depends on how you calculate the hidden costs of other treatments for fat. Unlike any type of liposuction, there is no downtime.</p><p>There are no garments to wear. No pads to change as you drain fluid. No scars. No cost to laser the scars. There is also no instant (within 3 days) gratification unfortunately. The direct cost of Cool Sculpting is related to the size of the applicator and the number of applications necessary to freeze all the fat you want to reduce.</p><p>There are different applicator sizes and the one that is right for you depends on your size and the area you want to treat. The company charges the physician several hundred dollars for each application so the minimal price is fixed by Zeltig.</p><p>If you do several areas at one time, most of us discount our list price since we don’t have to clean the room between each session, you can use the same disposable clothing, we only have to take one set of “before” photos, etc.</p><p>Our list is $750 for one small applicator and $1400 for one large applicator. The large applicator can freeze more than twice as much as the small ones but if the large one does not fit, you can’t use it.</p><p>We take before and after photographs. It is a free consult to determine if Cool Sculpting is right for the patient. We also offer Smart Lipo so we can make sure that our patients have options when considering treatment for fat reduction. (Rutledge Forney, MD, Atlanta Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Zeltiq Coolsculpting prices in Houston</em></p><p>In the Houston area, fat pads requiring the small and medium applicators (“love handles”, lower back, mid back, upper arms, thighs) cost $600 per side. Larger areas like the lower abdomen cost $1500. Cost-saving treatment packages are also available for multiple areas of treatment. (Narin (Joe) Apisarnthanarax, MD, Houston Dermatologist)</p><p>CoolSculpting by Zeltiq has become an outdated product with the advent of SculpSure.</p><p>SculpSure is the only FDA-approved laser to provide the quickest and most effective treatment in vanquishing unwanted stubborn subcutaneous fat. Please consult with a board certified facial plastic surgeon. (Ross A. Clevens, MD, Melbourne Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
