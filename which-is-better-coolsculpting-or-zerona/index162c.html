<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>In my opinion, CoolSculpting has proven to be better than Zerona. The Zerona is cleared for non invasive body contouring whereas the CoolSculpting is cleared for non invasive fat reduction.</p><p>So if you are looking to reduce a specific area, CoolSculpting is the better choice. (Suresh Koneru, MD, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting Vs. Zerona</strong></p><p>Cool sculpting permanently removes fat cells from the body while Zerona damages the cells causing the fat cells to leak out in to the lymph system but the cells will eventually heal themselves. (Edward Stokes, MD, West Hollywood Physician)</p><p><i>Coolsculpting versus Zerona</i></p><p>Fat reduction or contouring is a sought after procedure and there are several options available. Both technologies have been FDA approved but for different reasons and with different indications. Coolsculpting uses cold to produce cryolipolysis of the fat cells in specific areas of the body.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1232" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It is a permanent reduction of the fat cells but it is limited to certain areas of the body. The handpiece has to be able to grab onto the tissue and pull it into the handpiece to cool it between two plates.</p><p>The device works well for areas of the body that have some laxity and can fit into the handpiece to cool. Zerona was approved for non-invasive body contouring and works to change the membrane of the fat cell to shrink it.</p><p>Combined with diet and exercise there can be a contouring effect over the body. (Michelle J. Place, MD, Danville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Coolsculpting By Zeltiq is Effective Fat Elimination</h5><p>Coolsculpting has many clinical studies and happy patients ( including my staff) proving its efficacy in the real world. There is no doubt that I can make more of a change with Aqualipo or Smartlipo but many patients prefer not to go to the operating room or to have down time.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1233" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>Coolsculpting can eliminate targeted fat by greater than 20%. the procedure takes one hour per targeted area. There are no post operative protocols to follow for diet and exercise. the best candidates are one within 20 pounds of their BMIZerona cannot target exact areas.</p><p>It does not eliminate but shrink cells. It relies on diet and exercise. (Mark Berkowitz, MD, Sterling Heights Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Coolsculpting and Zerona are different</em></p><p>Coolsculpting and Zerona are very different technologies, with different goals and indications.</p><p>Coolsculpting uses cryolipolysis, with a specific cold temperature used to trigger elimination of fat cells. This reduces fat in targeted areas, and permanently removes the treated fat cells.</p><p>Coolsculpting has predictable and lasting results. Zerona is used by some for reduction of body circumference. It is combined with diet modification, and does not target specific areas. In addition, since the fat cells are shrunk and not eliminated, the results may not be permanent.</p><p>So the two treatments are not interchangable. They work differently, and should be used differently. In my Albany, NY practice, I favor Coolsculpting, as I have been consistently impressed with the results in properly selected patients. (Jeffrey Rockmore, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Coolsculpting and Zerona comparison</h3><p>Although both modalities reduce volume, the methods are completely different. Coolsculpting permanently destroys fat cells. This means you no longer have the same amount of fat cells in a treated area. Zerona draws the energy out of the fat cell, in other words it shrinks the fat cells.</p><p>Many Zerona practitioners advise patients to follow specific dietary guidelines in order to maintain their results otherwise the effected fat cells can swell again. Zerona does not offer a permanent means of eliminating fat from the body. (Pamela Gallagher, MD, Long Island Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1235" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I am a skeptic who generally does not buy into the hype of noninvasive fat reduction technology. However, there has been enough compelling evidence that CoolSculpting actually does work and I looked into it. I was a tough sell and required the Zeltiq rep to bring the machine to my office and treat my body on one upper hip only.</p><p><b>CoolSculpting vs. Zerona</b></p><p>I have found that CoolSculpting results in a significant improvement in the vast majority of patients. On the other hand, I have not been impressed with Zerona at all.</p><p>As someone who is doing a tremendous amount of CoolScuplting, I have seen quite a few patients who have been unsuccessful with Zerona and have done well with CoolSculpting. (Jonathan Crane, DO, Wilmington Dermatologist)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1236" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h4>Coolsculpting predictable but Zerona operator/patient dependent</h4><p>We brought Zerona into our office and used it on our staff. If it is perfectly administered and the patient follows the protocol perfectly, it may live up to its claims but I did not feel I could offer it to my patients in good conscience.</p><p>We sent it back. The science behind Coolsculpting is well proven and the scientists who developed the procedure are beyond reproach. The machine won’t work unless it is properly positioned. Coolsculpting is expensive and takes patience for results but patients who understand what it will do are very pleased with their results. (Rutledge Forney, MD, Atlanta Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>We provide CoolSculpting to our patients for non surgical fat reduction because it works</i></p><p>It is of course fair to “lump” these services together, I can only imagine how confusing our marketplace has become for a patient wanting to select a treatment.</p><p>In this case, you’ve asked how CoolSculpting and Zerona treatments compare, how to determine your candidacy, and quite possibly want help in making the right treatment selection for your needs.</p><p>We did not select Zerona as a treatment to offer our patients and have done our homework and research as well before making our decision.</p><p>We offer CoolSculpting and it is consistently providing patients with a reduction of unwanted fat and equally making our patients very happy with their results. We are confident in the thorough research and science behind CoolSculpting.</p><p>If you’re looking for more information on either treatment, I recommend you speak with a few practices in your area who offer the procedure and continue to read reviews from patients on RealSelf.com. (Gregory Mesna, MD, FACS, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting has much better studies and science behind it than Zerona. We were prepared to offer both CoolSculpting and Zerona to our clients. But, we were unable to find real evidence that Zerona is effective.</p><p>However, after considerable research with CoolSculpting, we have two systems and we have been very pleased with the safety and efficacy of this treatment. (Michael Law, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Within 3-4 weeks I was blown away by the results. Not what I could have done with liposuction, but a huge change. The lack of downtime and ease of recovery were similarly impressive. I treated the other side within 2 months as I was tired of being asymmetric.</p><p>The results I have seen on myself (now at 6 months) and the dozens of patients we have treated to this point have been impressive. I don’t own Zerona, and never will. The evidence does not support significant results and from what I can tell, any results achieved are temporary.
