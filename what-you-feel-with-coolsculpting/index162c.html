<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><strong>What does the CoolSculpting procedure feel like?</strong></p><p>Amongst the many nice things about CoolSculpting is how well tolerated the procedure is. At the start of the procedure one will feel a tugging sensation as the bulge is pulled up inside the CoolSculpting applicator.</p><p>Some of my patients have compared this to a mammogram i.e. awkward but easily tolerable. Once this has been achieved the cooling process begins. You will experience some cold but also easily tolerable and within 5-10 minutes the area will become numb.</p><p>At that point most patients spend the remaining treatment time reading, talking on their cellphone or napping. Several days after the procedure you may experience some mild sensitivity, pins and needles or numbness in the treated area.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3881" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-34995e66c422e6d315276f7e9f6196f4">

</div><p>A small minority of patients will describe a painful sensation in the area. This can be treated with products such as Advil/Motrin, a numbing patch or rarely a prescription strength pain reliever. Any numbness or discomfort after the procedure will resolve spontaneously within two weeks. (Ted Brezel, MD, Long Island Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>The greatest thing about coolsculpting is that it is non-invasive and is very comfortable for most patients. When the applicator is attached to the treated area there is an initial pulling and squeezing sensation followed by some tingling once the cooling process is started.</p><p>This will last for the first 8 minutes of the procedure. After that patients are very comfortable. Once the procedure is completed there is some tingling, numbness, and redness that usually resolves within a few hours after treatment, but can last several weeks.</p><p>Some patients can also experience bloating and swelling for 1-2 weeks after treatment as well.</p><p>Few patients will experience pain that starts on day 3-5 after the treatment and is related to the inflammatory reaction of the fat cells dying.</p><p>It can last for 1-2 weeks after the procedure and is effectively treated with lidocaine patches. (Rosalyn George, MD, Wilmington Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Sensations With CoolSculpting</h4><p>The most uncomfortable area is the abdomen. Especially with the 8.0 applicator. The pulling sensation is moderately uncomfortable until the cooling numbs the area. This is about 7-8 minutes. After that you don’t really feel anything.</p><p>Afterward you will have numbness of the area usually lasting 3-4 weeks. In addition you can get very different sensations. When I did my lower abdomen it felt like I had a sunburn occasionally, itching and a few sharp pains.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3883" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>They were all intermittent and lasted about 7-10 days. The day I did my abdomen I played 9 holes and ran 6 miles so there really isn’t any down time. The company has told us that rarely a patient will report severe pain that is easily treated with Lidoderm patches.</p><p>I’ve been using CoolSculpting since March and haven’t had any patients report this. It’s a great device that really works. (Christopher L. Hess, MD, Fairfax Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The thing I love about Coolsculpting is how easy it is, how fast you see a result, and what minimal to no down time there is for patients! When you have the small or medium applicator, you feel a mild to moderate suction and then it starts to become numb after 5 minutes.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3884" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>When you use the large applicator on the abdomen, it feels like a strong suction but once again it is numb after 5 minutes and some patients actually fall asleep! For 2-3 weeks after, you will feel slightly numb in the treated area.</p><p>Around 5 days after the procedure you may feel some sensitivity to touch, tingling, cramps, and twinges which usually resolve in two weeks but are easily resolved with tylenol or aleeve. I have never had to prescribe narcotics and we have performed hundreds of treatments. (Grace Liu, MD, Newport Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Late onset pain with coolsculpting</h4><p>In my practice, I have found that late onset pain does tend to occur with treatment of the abdomen and flank regions.</p><p>It is neuropathic pain that can be similar to shingles and occurs 5 to 7 days after the treatment and can last up to 2 weeks.</p><p>Late onset pain can be quite uncomfortable and I treat it with medications such as Lyrica or gabapentin as well as Lidoderm a aesthetic patches and within a few days it starts to improve.</p><p>There is anecdotal reports that wearing abdominal compression or binders this can be mitigated.</p><p>Also there are fewer reports of late onset pain with the new Cooladvantage. However CoolSculpting absolutely works and most of our clients have seen a visible improvement and satisfactions tends to be high (Hardik Soni, MD (not currently practicing), Summit Emergency Medicine Physician)</p><h5>Pain after Coolsculpting</h5><p>In our practice we have seen this after Coolsculpting the lower abdomen. We explain to our patients ahead of time that this may occur so they aren’t surprised. We tell them that it may feel like “ant bites” on the inside and it’s usually more noticeable at night or when they sit down. (Johnny J. Peet, MD, The Woodlands OB-GYN)</p><p>Definitely have seen this with thinner patients and patients who have had stacked treatments. The nerve symptoms are treated medically and should resolve. (Robert Whitfield, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting and Late Onset Pain</strong></p><p>Late onset pain is very uncommon for stomach and other areas. Our Lipo Spa clinics have not seen any difference in such pain for specific body areas. This is something that occasionally happens to a very small percentage of clients and can be managed by your Certified Coolsculpting provider. (Douglas Halliday, PhD, MD, Syracuse Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>CoolAdvantage CoolSculpting for less pain and discomfort</b></p><p>The CoolAdvantage treatments more evenly distribute the cooling process of the skin-fat bulge. It therefore provides a faster cooling cycle and we hear more and more that patients experience less discomfort. This does not mean you won’t have sharp pain or dull discomfort following any CoolSculpting treatment, even with the new or older applicators.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3887" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Mild swelling and very occasionally bruising does indicate a proper treatment session and I suspect you will have the desired effects of fat reduction. (Dean P. Kane, MD, FACS, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Some level of pain/discomfort can be expected from the treatments as a whole however not everybody has this. Peak results will be seen in about 3 months. Sit back, relax and watch the fat go away. (Paul Pietro, MD, Greenville Physician)</p><p><b>CoolSculpting is often pain free</b></p><p>CoolSculpting can cause the types of *shock* pains you were expecting, most commonly on the belly, rarely on the flanks.</p><p>But it does not happen in all patients, only some. And, the new cooladvantage applicators have a lower incidence of this delayed onset pain.</p><p>I am also excited to say that as one of the 7 centers across the country to be given the opportunity to work with the new fabulous CooladvantagePlus, I can tell you the fabulous results can happen with even less discomfort than before. Have no fear, no delayed onset pain does not mean no results. It does mean the CoolSculpting process is great; effective and comfortable. (Elizabeth Slass Lee, MD, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>No Pain with Cooladvantage</h4><p>Cool-advantage is the latest technology from Coolsculpt. The advantages are that it treats the fat in a 3D cup with cooler temperatures and has a shorter treatment time as well as much less post -treatment pain.</p><p>I am so glad that you were able to experience this great technology! We are seeing even better results with the cool advantage as well! Do not worry that you are not having the same pain as with the original treatments; That is normal. (Quenby Erickson, DO, FAAD, FACMS, Chicago Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Pain is not a direct correlation to results</b></p><p>Not having pain does not mean the treatment will not work for you. Pain is not necessarily correlated to the predicted results you will get.</p><p>Different areas will experience different levels of discomfort (or not) and different people will have different experiences based on pain tolerance as well. (Maiysha Clairborne, MD, Atlanta Family Physician)</p><p><em>No pain after CoolSculpting</em></p><p>Most patients tolerate the CoolSculpting procedure well. It is not common to have pain after the procedure. The fact that you have no pain does not predict anything about your results. Expect to start seeing some results at the 1 month mark and peak results at the 3 month mark. (Shaun Patel, MD, Miami Physician)</p><h5>Pain does not mean results</h5><p>Don’t be concerned about the absence of pain with CoolSculpting. The procedure is minimally invasive, and does not require pain to be effective. (Stephen J. Ronan, MD, FACS, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Most patients do not have any pain after CoolSculpting and the presence or absence of pain after the treatment is not indicative of the final result. Be happy that you did not have any pain afterwards and wait 3-4 months to see your full result. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting does not require pain in order to eliminate fat cells! Keep, in mind every ones pain tolerance is different. CoolSculpting is consider the “lunch time” procedure, do to the fact that there is if any, minimal discomfort associated with the treatment.</p><p>Follow up with your treatment facility to schedule “after” pictures, to really gage your results.
