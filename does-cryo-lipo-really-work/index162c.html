<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h5>Cryo lipo Really Works</h5><p>Coolsculpting has become the gold standard for noninvasive fat reduction. It absolutely works and if a patient is a good candidate for the procedure it will give a 20 – 25% reduction of the fat in the treated area.</p><p>In order to determine if a patient is a good candidate for the Coolsculpting procedure there must be “pinchable” subcutaneous fat in the area being treated.</p><p>That means fat directly under the skin that you can pinch between your fingers, versus visceral fat or fat inside the abdominal cavity.</p><p>So it is important to have an in person consultation to make sure you are a good candidate.</p><p>Once the fat is treated with Coolsculpting, the fat reduction that is achieved will yield a permanent result, because the body does not make new fat cells.</p><p>So once a fat cell is destroyed or removed from the body, it is removed permanently (Paul Flashner, MD, Boston Physician)</p><h4>CoolSculpting Works!</h4><p>CoolSculpting works! Patient selection and appropriate expectations are essential in receiving the best results.</p><p>Cryo lipo is great for removing stubborn areas of fat for people at or near a healthy weight. For people interested in losing a significant amount of weight, CoolSculpting is not the ideal procedure.</p><p>Additionally, with the advent of the cool advantage and dual sculpting multiple areas can be treated to shorten treatment times and enhance results. In our practice we encourage treating each area twice to maximize the results.</p><p>After the treatment appropriate massage therapy is also very important to increase circulation and allow the fat cells to be eliminated more efficiently. (Steven M. Camp, MD, Fort Worth Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Fat Reduction Results</h3><p>The key to good results is patient selection. Our facility have specialists that have undergone in depth training and certification to ensure patient safety and selection.</p><p>Coolsculpting treatments are only performed in medical offices under the supervision of a licensed professional to guarantee the highest standards of care.</p><p>The CoolScultping fat freezing procedure is the only FDA cleared, non surgical fat reduction treatment that uses controlled cooling to eliminate stubborn fat that resists all efforts through diet and exercise. The results are proven, noticeable and lasting.</p><p>I urge you to call an accredited facility for a consultation to learn more about this procedure and to deem your candidacy. (Jon Paul Trevisani, MD, FACS, Maitland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Does CoolSculpting really work</em></p><p>Yes, it really works. As a high volume provider of CoolSculpting treatments, we find selecting the right patient is the best way to get a great result.</p><p>Patients who have fat that is resistant to diet and exercise seem to do the best though even those who diet and exercise occasionally have had good results.</p><p>Seeing a coolsculpting provider who has performed at least a thousand procedures and has also been trained by CoolSculpting University is the best place to start so you can get a full treatment plan to give you the most contoured appearance. (Mike Majmundar, MD, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Coolsculpting is liposuction’s best alternative, without question.</b></p><p>Zeltiq’s Coolsculpting device works without question to reduce your unwanted fat. It is a non-invasive liposuction alternative that is done in the office, without needles or incisions, and without downtime. As such, this technology has literally changed the way we think about body enhancement due to the results we see and the scientific studies that have been published.</p><p>Treatment areas include upper & lower tummy, flanks, love handles, back fat, banana rolls (under the buttock), inner thighs, and now the saddle bags. In order to get satisfying results (20% fat reduction) you’ll need to do 2-3 treatments in each of your trouble spot(s).</p><p>So it’s a process. But it certainly works. (Randolph Capone, MD, FACS, Baltimore Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>After researching CoolSculpting for more than a year, as well as reviewing many articles and online reviews by patients, we decided to purchase a machine. After very positive results initially, we purchased a second machine.</p><p>This allows for much quicker treatments as one can treat two areas at once. CoolSculpting has generated much interest in our practice for non surgical fat removal and continues to generate a lot of interest.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_144" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>So I can say this absolutely works and I believe this technology is here to stay. (Kurtis Martin, MD, Cincinnati Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Zeltiq (CoolSculpting) Really Works!</h4><p>Yes, cryo lipo really works. We know that if fat is frozen 20% to 25% of the fat cells will be destroyed permanently. The selection of patients is very important. If a patient has a lot of fat and only 20-25% of fat is destroyed the patient will not be happy as there is still a lot of fat.</p><p>Cryo lipo works best when there is a fat bulge that you can pinch easily and the fat is soft like at the the abdomen or love handles. If the fat bulge is hard it will not work very well either because there is a lot of fibrous tissue, so treating patients with hard and firm fibrous fat will not make the patients happy.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_145" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>CoolSculpting is not just about fat freeze. It is an Art. One will have to pinch the various fat bulges to make sure that CoolSculpting will work for you and to achieve the best contour.</p><p>We also combine CoolSculpting with Venus Freeze to tighten the skin to obtain even better results. So how do you find the best doctor? You will have to do the homework. Find out who does the most CoolSculpting in your area and ask the doctor whether his center is certified, ask for references and look at before and after pictures and of course look at the social media and make sure that patients are thrilled with the results. (Choon Kia Yeo, MD, Honolulu General Surgeon)</p><p>We have had much experience with coolsculpt. I have even had it myself. It really does work and this is why it is becoming more popular. We have had patients return multiple times and refer their friends.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_146" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The doctor will determine if you are a good candidate. This is most important. (Miguel Delgado, MD, San Rafael Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>CoolSculpting works for fat reduction</b></p><p>CoolSculpt can effectively reduce fat cells in as little as 1 hour and with no downtime. It is noninvasive and virtually painless. Multiple treatments may be required depending on the areas and that can be determined during your consultation.</p><p>Most people see results within 3 months, with improved contour and noticeable fat reduction. The most common complaints post treatment are numbness for up to several weeks and soreness for several days. CoolSculpt can be used on the abdomen, back, love handles, bra rolls, saddle bags, thighs and banana rolls.</p><p>Results can vary from person to person as with any treatment. Consult with the person providing your treatment to see if you are a candidate for this non-surgical procedure. (Steven H. Williams, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Sacramento CoolSculpting Really Reduces Fat</h5><p>CoolSculpting actually reduces the fat in treated areas about 25%. The resulting shape change can take 3-4 months to fully reveal itself. More improvement can be achieved by re-treating the area a second time. The best shape changes occur when a comprehensive Treatment to Transformation program is performed.</p><p>The best part is that the treatment is nonsurgical with no downtime.(Thomas E. Kaniff, MD, FACS, Sacramento Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Zeltiq CoolSculpting Works! My Staff Loves It and Has Had the Procedure Themselves</i></p><p>Coolsculpting works! Not only are there multiple scientific papers that prove it but patients continued to be blown over by this non-surgical treatment. This liposuction alternative give results that average a 22% reduction. many will have more than one treatment to obtain even better results.</p><p>In our office we offer comfortable robes and slippers for you to wear while you relax during the one hour procedure. We have wi-fi available so you can even watch a movie on Netflix! (Mark Berkowitz, MD, Sterling Heights Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p></div>
