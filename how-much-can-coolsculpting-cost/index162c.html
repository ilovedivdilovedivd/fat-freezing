<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>CoolSculpting pricing is set by the manufacturer so most places that offer CoolSculpting should be very similar.</p><p>Some practices may have events that offer special pricing throughout the year but that would vary per practice.</p><p>When considering this treatment, besides pricing, be sure that they are a Certified CoolSculpting Practice to offer you a treatment plan that is best for you and that the technician is certified and trained by Zeltiq/Allergan.</p><p>Should you not be a candidate then having a practice that has alternatives is important as well. (Randolph Capone, MD, FACS, Baltimore Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of CoolSculpting procedure will depend on the number of cycles needed and how any areas you wish to treat.</p><p>Each person is unique and and will receive a customized treatment plan that is tailored specifically to meet your individual needs and goals. (Timothy Zelko, DO, Westmont Physician)</p><h4>Price will vary but will be reduced if you buy packages</h4><p>Most people that get cool sculpting will need several sessions to get results. If you purchase each session individually the cost in Beverly Hills at our practice is about $750 per applicator.</p><p>If patients purchase packages, the price of each individual application will go down significantly. (Sameer Bashey, MD, Beverly Hills Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>How much CoolSculpting costs</h3><p>The Coolsculpting investment depends on a few factors.</p><ol>
<li>the area being treated,</li>
<li>the number of applicators required to treat any given area,</li>
<li>the type of applicators used,</li>
<li>the number of treatments required to achieve the desired result.</li>
</ol><p>That is why it is very difficult to give a precise investment. As an example, let’s say a patient wanted to treat their belly fat. They could be treating the lower abdomen (below the belly button), the mid abdomen (above the belly button), the upper abdomen (below rib cage).</p><p>They may require 1 treatment if they are closer to their ideal body weight, or 2 treatments if there is a more significant area to be treated. So you can see that the possibilities are many.</p><p>This patient may only treat the lower abdomen one time (an investment of approximately $1500) or may treat all three sections of the abdomen two times (an investment of approximately $5000).</p><p>Typically the more applicators you require for best results, the more the price per applicators gets reduced. Since there are many clinics offering CoolSculpting now, and the prices are more or less comparable, the most important decision is finding a clinic that has had the technology for some time, has experienced technicians that have the most up-to-date training and has the newest generation of applicators. (Manish Khanna, MD, FRCP(C), Montreal Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_17" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h4>How much does CoolSculpting cost?</h4><p>The price is pretty similar everywhere as Zeltiq will not allow it to be lowered beyond a certain number. It will depend on the area you wish to have treated and how many cycles are needed.</p><p>This ranges a lot. Look at the before and after section, several of the photos have the area and the number of cycles they had done. Estimate that each cycle is about 750 in my office(certainly there are packages that will be less for volume discounts which vary).</p><p>Keep in mind going bargain hunting with your body is not a good idea. It is the only one you have, trust it only to a certified plastic surgeon who performs the full range of cosmetic body treatments so that if CoolSculpting is not right for you, they can discuss all the other options you may have so that you get the results you are looking for. (W. John Bull, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Cost for fat reduction Coolsculpting by Zeltiq</b></p><p>Pricing for fat reduction with CoolSculpting depends on what you are asking. Patients typically want to know how much it will cost to treat an area, however, that can mean something different for every patient.</p><p>Each time we place an applicator on an area that has excess fat, it costs $700-1400 depending on which applicator is used. There are five different sizes; Mini, Petite, Six inch (cooladvantage), Eight inch (coolmax), and Coolsmooth.</p><p>The real question to ask your ABMS Plastic Surgeon is how many times an applicator needs to be placed on the area in question to meet your goals.</p><p>Often times laser liposuction is more cost effective than Coolsculpting. (Laurie A. Casas, MD, FACS, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting Consultation</i></p><p>An accurate price quote can be given after a body consultation, during which we will discuss your areas of concern. Ultimately the price depends on the size of the treatment area and the number of treatments needed.</p><p>We offer competitive pricing in Manhattan. Please come in for a complimentary consultation. (Joseph A. Eviatar, MD, FACS, New York Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Coolsculpting pricing</b></p><p>It is very hard to quote a price for this type of treatment without seeing the patient in person. There are several key factors that must be evaluated and the patients expectations must be reasonable.</p><p>All of these things are discussed at your consultation. Also every office is different with pricing due to geographical location and special pricing that may be offered for multiple treatments and treatment areas. On average the cost can range from $600-$1400 per area. (Neda Vanden Bosch, MD, West Palm Beach Physician)</p><p><b>Coolsculpting Cost versus quality </b></p><p>One should consider the following facts while choosing the coolsculpting cost.</p><ol>
<li>Does the price include a coolsculpt consultation with a qualified, experienced and board certified physician? Can your physician get a detailed health history and examine you personally before recommending the total number of treatments or alternatives?</li>
<li>How long has the facility performed coolsculpting? Does the facility use the newer applicators?</li>
<li>Do they offer Dualsculpting and other complimentary procedures such as Z wave treatment to enhance the coolsculpt results and reduce the post procedure discomfort?</li>
<li>Is the facility invested in meeting your long term aestheic goals or is it offering deep discounts on a single procedure?</li>
<li>Is the facility similar to an assembly line or will you receive personalized care? We were the first physician practice to offer Coolsculpting to the Northshore area of Boston,MA.</li>
</ol><p>We have two machines and new applicators, I have personally personally performed over a thousand procedures. We are certified Coolsculpt practice and graduates of coolsculpting University. All of the above factors are included in our pricing. (Shanthala Shivananjappa, MD, Boston Physician)</p><h5>Treatment cost varies from patient to patient</h5><p>Coolsculpting cost range depending on which area you are needing fat reduction in . Also larger applicators generally cost more per cycle than the smaller applicators.</p><p>It would also depend on if you would need more than one treatment in the desired area as Coolsculpting affects 20-25% of the fat cells in treated area.</p><p>Some practices will discount the second treatment if its needed. It’s best to schedule a consultation to see exactly which applicators would work best for you and how many treatments it would take to achieve your desired results. (Pushpendra Jain, MD, Cookeville Physician)</p><p><strong>Cost of Coolsculpting is dependent on the patient</strong></p><p>Coolsculpting pricing is carefully monitored and set by Zeltiq so that pricing does not vary widely. It also depends on what the individual patient desires. Coolsculpting is a non-surgical option to surgery (liposuction) that results in 25% reduction of fat in the area.</p><p>It, like liposuction, is not a weight loss procedure. Similar results in certain areas can occur with Coolsculpting with repeated treatments. Most patients choose Coolsculpting over liposuction because Coolscupting does not require any anesthesia, requires no needles, and has no downtime.</p><p>As long as patients understand that Coolsculpting will not result in large volume fat reduction, it can be a great alternative to surgery. (Mark E. Mason, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Cost of treatment considerations</strong></p><p>One consideration with pricing for a lipolysis treatment (Coolsculpting or Sculpsure) is whether the treatment is customizable to the shape of the fat distribution on the patient. Sculpsure is fully adjustable to fit any treatment configuration without paying for unneeded treatment areas. (Jeffrey T. Camp, MD, Truckee Physician)</p></div>
