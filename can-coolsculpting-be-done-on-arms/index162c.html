(Amir Moradi, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i> Zeltiq CoolScultping for arm fat</i></p><p>Yes, we have seen great results when treating stubborn fat pockets on men and women The key is if in fact this is fat or muscle.

</div><p>These are usually areas that are difficult to reduce with diet and exercise regimens and up until now actual liposuction was the only real solution. (Joshua L. Fox, MD, Long Island Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>Coolsculpting for arms</h5><p>There is a smaller applicator that for most people can fit on your arm. It requires some fat as well as some degree of skin laxity in order for the device to suction the skin into the handpiece.</p><p>You also want to keep in mind that this procedure is to reduce fat and will not address skin laxity if that happens to be the main issue. It is always best to be evaluated first by your physician. (Lori A. Brightman, MD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting® is FDA-cleared for the flanks (love handles) and abdomen and is proven to be a safe and effective treatment. Unfortunately, at this time it is not approved for use on arm fat.

</div><p>We have had excellent results with arm fat with also additional tightening of the overlying skin. The main caveat is selecting the right patient. It is really important to be measured with the template applicators during a consult to see if your fat can fit the smallest applicator.</p><p>Since every person is different, you won’t know until you are evaluated with the template to see if your fat can be sucked into an applicator to be treated.</p><p>Zeltiq is developing a different applicator in the future for harder to treat areas like arms and legs but currently the info is that it won’t be released for at least another six months and is still in testing.

</div><p>We have successfully treated several patients for this problem now- all are very happy.</p><p>The improvement is not as great as when the arm is treated with VASER lipo, but for those wishing to avoid surgery, it is a safe and effective alternative. (Armando Soto, MD, FACS, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Can I treat my arms with CoolSculpting</b></p><p>Yes, you can. CoolSculpting is “off-label” for arm treatments, but it can be done. See a physician who does a lot of CoolSculpting and who will evaluate you honestly. Some people aren’t good candidates for arm CoolSculpting.</p><p>If you go to an office that ONLY offers CoolSculpting, they may not be as likely to tell you that. (Carmen Kavali, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Zeltiq CoolSculpting has applicators best suited for muffin top or love handles and belly fat. New applicators are being developed. We don’t presently recommend it for the upper arms.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1099" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

Stay tuned. (Susan Van Dyke, MD, Paradise Valley Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Zeltig for upper arm fat</i></p><p>Coolsculpting has been used for upper arm fat. However, it must be done cautiously and will not result in tightening of lax skin. So, patients need to understand that it will not get rid of or work very well when the skin is pendulous and lax. (Steven Hacker, MD, West Palm Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1100" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><h4>Zeltiq – Coolsculpting fat reduction</h4><p>Many areas throughout the body can be treated safely with Coolsculpting. With the smaller applicators, even the upper arm region can be treated successfully. The ideal candidate however is someone who is 5-30 pounds over their ideal body weight.</p><p>Coolsculpting seems to also work best on the “looser” or “softer” fat that we see in the belly or inner thigh regions. It does however, work well on the proper candidate in the upper arm region. (Jon E. Mendelsohn, MD, Cincinnati Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Can be treated if you are a good candidate</i></p><p>Coolsculpting can be a great option for you as long as you are a good candidate for the procedure. I would recommend going to the office where you plan on having the treatment to determine if Coolsculpting will work for you.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1101" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>In short, you need to have the type of fat on your arm that is able to be suctioned up into the applicator in order to be treated. (Renato Saltz, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Upper Arm Fat</strong></p><p>Zeltiq can be used in the upper and lower abdomen, love handles, back fat, inner thighs and the upper arms. You will need to see a Zeltiq provider to make sure that you are a candidate for the procedure.</p><p>I have used Zeltiq on the upper arms and it works quite well, not only does it reduce fat, but you obtain some skin retraction as well. (David Finkle, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Zeltiq Cool Sculpting Used For Upper Arm Fat</strong></p><p>The Zeltiq cool sculpting device uses suction to get a good hold of the area to be addressed. That said, if the upper arm fat is of a given size that allows the device to get a good hold of the area through suction then undergoing the cool sculpting is very much possible.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1102" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I recommend that you go for a consultation to make sure if the areas you like to be targeted are large enough. Usually, the abdomen, flanks and back are the most popular areas patients would like to address. (Ali Sajjadian, MD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>The Upper Arm is a Great Region for CoolSculpting to be Performed</strong></p><p>Zeltiq CoolSculpting can be used for almost any part of the body where the tissue is elastic enough that it can be pulled up into the applicator of the machine so the treatment can be applied (one exception is the neck).</p><p>The upper arm is actually a good region for this type of treatment and CoolSculpting is the only nonoperative treatment for that area. CoolSculpting is a technique where a cold force is applied to the tissue that causes the lipid in the fat calls to freeze and crystalize.</p><p>When the tissue warms up again the crystals do not melt and they cause the death of those fat cells. The body then naturally flushes them out over the next three to four months. One caution about CoolSculpting is that it only results in about a 20% (one-fifth) reduction of the tissue that gets up into the applicator.</p><p>If more improvement than that is desired then repeated treatments or a more invasive method of treatment such as liposuction or brachioplasty may need to be considered. (Marie E. Montag, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Each patient is going to be different in terms of arm fat and the ability of the applicator to work on there arm. Please be seen and evaluated because this may be a great option for you. (Robert Whitfield, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Treating upper arms with Cool Sculpting</i></p><p>Yes, coolsculpting can be used on the under arm area. The coolfit applicator is flat and allows for proper placement to effectively treat the fatty tissue commonly referred to as “batwings”. Keep in mind that treating arms with skin laxity can look worse when fat is reduced so patient selection must be thoughtful.</p><p>Certified technicians will be able to evaluate the area and determine the best placement as well as making sure you are a good candidate for treating arms. (Frank J. Baron, MD, Mercer Island Dermatologist)</p><p></p>

<br><strong>Can Coolsculpting be used for Upper Arm fat?</strong><p>Typically not, but some physicians have had a good experience with it. See a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon. (Arthur M. Cambeiro, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>CoolSculpting on arms</h5><p>Arms can be treated with CoolSculpting, but you will have to have a consultation in order to assess the area to make sure you are a good candidate for the treatment. With the current handpieces, not everyone will be an ideal candidate depending on your anatomy.</p><p>Keep in mind that if you have loose skin, it may worse once the fat is reduced from the arms. It is best to get evaluated to see if this treatment will work for your areas of concern. (Steven H. Williams, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>CoolSculpting by Zeltiq can be used on upper arm fat</h3><p>Yes, provided the applicator that is currently available fits the upper outer arm, then fat reduction can be done as an off-label procedure. There can be nerve sensitivity so discuss all benefits and risks with your physician. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting can be used for upper arm fat as long as there is enough fat to be suctioned into the vacuum handpiece of the Zeltiq machine. (Cameron Rokhsar, MD, FAAD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Unfortunately, Coolsculpting is only FDA approved for the abdomen, love handles, and upper back. When it gets FDA approval for the arms, it could be a great area to treat. (Jeffrey E. Schreiber, MD, FACS, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>You can see before and after photos of coolsculpting of arms in our gallery at </strong></p><ol>
