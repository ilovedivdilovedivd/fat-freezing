<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><i>Coolsculpting and Menstruation</i></p><p>If properly performed, coolsculpting should have no effect on menstruation. Consult with your OBGYN to determine if there are alternative explanations. Your OBGYN will contact your treating physician if there appears to be any linkage to the coolsculpting treatment. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting targets the fat layer just beneath the skin and does not affect the tissues underneath that nor the deeper organs. It is very unlikely that CoolSculpting damaged your ovaries. It’s always a good idea to follow up with the person who treated you to have them address your concerns or your primary care physician. (Steven H. Williams, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Would CoolSculpting get rid of fat on upper lip from fat transfer?</h3><p>There are not yet any CoolSculpting applicators that have been developed to treat any part of the face or neck, including the lips, so CoolSculpting would not be an option for you to help with the fat in your upper lip after a fat transfer.</p><p>It is possible that the lip might be able to be improved with surgery, but you would need to be examined to determine if you might be a candidate for such a procedure. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Coolsculpting of upper lip?</h5><p>No, at this time coolsculpting cannot be used to treat the face. There is no applicator for that region. (Suzanne Kim Doud Galli, MD, PhD, FACS, Washington Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>CoolSculpting after Lipo</h4><p>It is not advisable to perform CoolSculpting over and open wound, or an area where the tissue is not completely healed. We don’t usually recommend performing CoolSculpting on a surgically treated area until 8-12 months post-op.</p><p>Speaking with your surgeon about evaluating the treated area may help you determine a better timeline. It may also help to wait a few months after your lipo and tummy tuck to see what areas CoolSculpting will be most effective.</p><p>There are very few contraindications to CoolSculpting, and epilepsy is not one of them. (Vincent A Marino, MD, Scottsdale Physician)</p><h5>Can CoolSculpting be done on stomach a week before a tubal ligation?</h5><p>I would recommend that you discuss your plan, to have CoolSculpting a week before your tubal ligation, with the surgeon performing your tubal ligation. While I do not believe that CoolSculpting should affect results of your tubal ligation, and vice versa, if the area of the surgery is close enough to the area that is treated with CoolSculpting there could be an issue with performing the surgery.. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Coolsculpting and tubal ligation</h4><p>You may want to check with your surgeon as to what they think of the coolsculpting and planned tubal. It is unlikely that the coolsculpting will be a problem with the tubal but it depends on where the tubal incision will be. (Terrence Murphy, MD, Englewood Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Space CoolSculpting and Tubal Ligation</b></p><p>CoolSculpting only affects the areas directly under the handpiece. However, some patients report swelling and tenderness. These symptoms will mask whatever pain you might feel after the tubal ligation – if there were untoward events.</p><p>Why not have tubal ligation first and CoolSculpting three months after? (Justin Harper, MD, Columbus Physician)</p><h4>CoolSculpting Price</h4><p>CoolSculpting is a very personalized treatment. The cost is determined by the number of applicators needed per treatment plan. The amount of applicators depends on the size of the area being treated. The price can also vary from provider to provider.</p><p>Make sure to consult with an experienced Certified CoolSculpting Specialist to see if you are a candidate and to figure out your treatment plan. (Jeffrey M. Hartog, DMD, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Cost of CoolSculpting for lower abdomen</em></p><p>The cost of CoolSculpting for for lower abdomen can vary by physician and also by patient. The size of the area to be treated will determine the size and number of applicators needed, and that will determine the cost. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Indentation after coolsculpting</h3><p>Coolsculpting is a great procedure when planned out correctly, however, if an area is only treated in one spot it is possible to be left with an indentation if there is still fat in the area surrounding it.</p><p>I usually do a full consult and make sure each patient is aware that one attachment will probably not give ideal results. My advice would be to follow up with the office that you did your procedure and discuss your options to treat the area surrounding the indentation. (Janet Allenby, DO, Delray Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Redness after Coolsculpting</strong></p><p>There is redness and sometimes bruising in the area treated. Normally the redness lasts just a day but if you are one of the patients who gets bruising, that may not be a good thing if you need to wear a bikini.</p><p>Maybe you want to do the procedure when you a have a bit more time – just incase! (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>After correspondingly will I be swollen and red? Help!</strong></p><p>school sculpting is the FDA approved nonsurgical treatment that literally freezes fat. It reduces the area of fat that is gathered up in the treatment head by between 20 and 26%. We’ve had the device and our practice now for 18 months and has been outstanding.</p><p>I can tell you from personal experience that the treatment is somewhat uncomfortable on the abdomen but on other areas, such as the proceeds for Chile painless. There is no anesthesia recovery it is simply common have the procedure go home.</p><p>There can be a small amount of bruising and some discomfort that last for a few hours to a few days but it is usually minimal. There may be some swelling but usually this very transient as well as the redness that is usually very short-lived also. (Joseph Hunstad, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Is Coolsculpting right for you?</h4><p>Zeltiq, who manufactures the technology is one of the most professional and integrity based companies that my practice has had the pleasure of working with.</p><p>They are adamant about training and certifying technicians with new applications and information. With that said, should you doubt the information you received from your physician than you should research the provider. </p><p>Read reviews from his treated patients, see before and afters, ask them how many treatments they have performed and schedule a second consultation.</p><p>I believe integrity plays a big role in patient selection. I’m sure your physician feels the same. The more informed you are about the provider and the technology you are considering, the better your expectations will be met.</p><p>By the way, a large spot on the abdomen and two smaller ones for muffin top are probably the most popular procedure we do. I’m sure he has your best interest at heart. (Lee B. Daniel, MD, Eugene Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4231" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-1718a8105512214d9486fd4f0a714a4e">

</div><p>Sculpsure is laserlipolisis instead of cryolipolisis and has business size applicators which take an average of 4 applicators for the lower abdomen and 2-3 for the upper abdomen.</p><p>These areas are recommended to do done at the same time. Was she maybe going to also treat your hip area? I would go for a second opinion, and see if they are on the same page.</p><p>There are a variety of configurations that can be used but the number of applicators should be close. (Neda Vanden Bosch, MD, West Palm Beach Physician)</p><h5>CoolSculpting vs Home Device</h5><p>CoolSculpting is an FDA cleared device with proven efficacy and safety for fat reduction. Devices that patients are able to use at home are not highly regulated or tested and may not even be safe or effective. (Steven H. Williams, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Ice on eyelids will not work</h4><p>Ice on your eyelids will not reduce fat. If you have excess fat in the upper or lower eyelid area the only way to address it is via surgery. This surgery is called a blepharoplasty. (Burton M. Sundin, MD, Richmond Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>If Coolsculpting can freeze fat away, can I do it at home with ice? More specifically on my eyelids?</b></p><p>This would not be safe and can cause damage to your skin and eyes. If you have concerns, please speak to a board certified plastic surgeon. (Martin Jugenburg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The areas treated with Coolsculpting have already been treated and the cells that are going to respond have already been “hit”. It is important to have a healthy diet and consume the least amount of alcohol possible.</p><p>Having said that, there is no clinical contraindication from drinking alcohol after this procedure. (Steven Swengel, MD, Los Gatos Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Heat should not effect Zeltiq results</i></p><p>Heat should not effect your Zeltiq results. The fat cells that are affected by the cryolipolysis will not “revive” once they are damaged. I would suggest you avoid these heat treatments for a few days after your Zeltiq treatment however, to avoid inflaming the area. (Lorrie Klein, MD, Laguna Niguel Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>A second treatment, is it necessary?</em></p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4229" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In order to see visible results, each area treated must be treated at least two times (2 hours or for the CoolSmooth handpiece, 4 hours).</p><p>In one hour of treatment, some fat cells may undergo cryoliposis but many fat cells get to the brink of cryoliposis in the 1st hour but need the second hour to push them over the edge.</p><p>With certainty, the few patients that insisted on one hour saw results, but not the same level of results as the patients that treat each area twice. It is common to “stack” a procedure which means you treat the same area twice in one sitting, back to back.</p><p>This an effective and aggressive approach to treatment. It would best for you to schedule a consult with at a Certified CoolSculpting Practice to discuss what approach would be best for you at this juncture. (Peter J. Capizzi, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
