<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><strong>Coolsculpting medical benefits</strong></p><p>Coolsculpting can provide psychological benefits to those who are concerned about their appearance. It can improve self confidence and give a feeling of improved self worth. I have also seen in many patients that it can jump start a weight reduction incentive.</p><p>Many patients have benefited in this way. (Maurice M. Vick, Jr., MD, Baton Rouge Urologist)</p><p>Studies have shown that CoolSculpting does not increase lipids blood level after treatments. However, there is no studies done to see if it improves cholesterol, triglycerides or type 2 diabetes. CoolSculpting does get rid of subcutaneous fat, the fat that is pinchable, and not the visceral fat.</p><p>Visceral fat plays a big role in diabetes and other illnesses. The most important thing is to have and maintain an active and healthy lifestyle. CoolSculpting will help with the way you look and feel. (Alain Michon, MD, Ottawa Physician)<br>
<i>Does CoolSculpting provide any medical benefits</i></p><p>It would be great if there was a direct added health benefit from Coolsculpting, but no, there has been no proof that the procedure decreases cholesterol, triglycerides or reduces the possibility of being diabetic. Coolsculpt does not take the place of good nutrition and exercise.</p><p>Its Goal is to provide sliming and contouring by reducing the number of fat cells (it does break them apart) and not meant as a weight loss device. With that said, I have many who have done Coolsculpt and liked the result so much that they increased or started exercising and/or changed their diet and life style- so indirectly it has had some health benefits.</p><p>It will only work on the pinchable fat, not the fat around the organs. So it is always important to keep your healthy habits. (Jeffrey Goldstein, DO, New York Physician)<br>
Coolsculpting is good for removing stubborn areas of fat that can’t be improved with diet or exercise. It is recommended to be at or near your ideal weight to get good results. Also, keep in mind, for best results with Coolsculpting, a combination approach is needed. (Jason Emer, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p> there is no proven co-relation of improvement of HBA1c with coolsculpting. Now if you are close to your ideal body weight and want to get rid of unwanted fat coolsculpting will work great as long as the fat is not intra abdominal.</p><p>In our experience loosing that extra bulge has motivated people to spend more time on fitness to keep the diabetes under check. (Ramandeep Sidhu, MD, Issaquah Vascular Surgeon)</p><p><b>CoolSculpting for belly fat and diabetes</b><br>
I often get patients that that come in for liposuction or CoolSculpting hoping it will improve their diabetes or high cholesterol issue. Unfortunately, CoolSculpting (or Liposuction for that matter) only removes the subcutaneous fat and this HAS NOT been shown to affect A1C.</p><p>Continue to be exercise and consider seeing a dietician for weight loss tips as even a small amount of weight loss may help your A1C. (John Bergeron, MD, Houston Physician)</p><p><b>Coolsculpting the Banana Roll, Under Glute area</b></p><p>We routinely treat the area under the glutes and achieve smooth, natural looking results. This area, known as the “banana roll”, responds beautifully to Coolsculpting. The separation and definition of the glutes is brilliantly accomplished.</p><p>We offer free consultations to determine if the prospective patient is a candidate for the procedure. Using the CoolAdvantage Applicators, this area can be treated in just 35 minutes. Many clients do need to treat twice for optimal results.<br>

</div>Frequently, clients who want to treat the banana roll are pleasantly surprised to learn that we can also treat the bra bulge, the upper and lower abs, love handles, inner and outer thighs, upper arms, the double chin, and even the pocket of fat above the knee.
<p>We have a total of 7 Coolsculpting machines with all of the latest applicators. Coolsculpting has advanced to the point that we can treat almost anything. Coolsculpting is the absolute best FDA cleared, non-invasive and non-surgical way to reshape the body. (Edward Stokes, MD, West Hollywood Physician)</p><h5>CoolSculpting Under The Butt</h5><p>CoolSculpting can work around the buttock area, also known as the “banana roll’. Normally, we recommend multiple treatments on the area for best results. I would recommend talking to a board certified plastic surgeon first to get the best advice. (Bhupesh Vasisht, MD, Voorhees Plastic Surgeon)<br>
<b>When do fat cells die after a CoolSculpting treatment?</b></p><p>It takes several months to see the full results after a CoolSculpting treatment, but the first signs of improvement can be seen as soon as a month after treatment. The fat cells are not immediately killed off when the procedure is done, as it takes some time for the process to occur. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Impact of Coolsculpting on Fat Cells</h3><p>The cold temperature injures the fat cells and induces apoptosis, a process of “controlled” cell death. Not all fat cells will enter this process which explains the fat “reduction” and not total fat removal. The process takes time, usually 2 to 3 months. (Frank P. Fechner, MD, Worcester Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Looking for the best non-invasive body sculpting treatment</b></p><p>Body sculpting can be done non-invasively such as CoolSculpting, Sculpture, or Vanquish or invasively, such as liposuction, SmartLipo/LaserLipo, or Vaser liposuction. Which procedure to use depends on the amount of fat to be permanently removed, the condition of the skin ( loose or taut not needing tightening), the expectations of the patient (invasive treatments can be more precise in the sculpting), and cost.</p><p>Cost varies as to the type of treatment that you decide to have. There are many good physicians who do these procedures and would be able to help you decide what treatment will best address your concerns.</p><p>I always suggest to patients that they do their research on the physician ahead of time and be willing to ask plenty of questions, including asking to see photos of their results to see if these will match your expectations.<br>
You can also ask to speak with one of their patients if this would be important to you. (Mary Beth Mudd, MD, Columbus Physician)</p><p><i>Noninvasive fat removal</i></p><p>At our office we utilize several noninvasive techniques, CoolSculpting which freezes fat, Radiofrequency, which heats fat, Vanquish and Vela Shape and ultrasound which kills fat with soundwaves through Our Ultra Shape machine.</p><p>We use these devices in combination to eliminate the exact problem you are talking about ,stubborn fat which stays in place regardless of diet and exercise. I would seek a body center which utilizes several methods for the best possible outcome.</p><p>Many of the centers do not charge for the initial consultation but you should be prepared to pay somewhere between $1500 to $5000 depending on how much fat you wish to remove. (Adrienne E. Stewart, MD, Denver Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>The fat is broken down by the body</h5><p>coolsculpting is based on the premise that cold injury can be harnessed to produce repeatable results. imagine the tissue damage that occurs during frostbite. cold in its extremes can lead to the loss of digits, and the tip of the nose, and even worse.</p><p>fat responds to cold injury more rapidly that the surrounding tissues. the fat is metabolized by the body over 6-8 weeks after treatment and excreted through the liver and kidneys, like all metabolic wastes. (Eric Chang, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>CoolSculpting for sides or middle of abdomen?</h3><p>It is fine to have two (or more) consecutive procedures of CoolSculpting done on the same day.  Each physician may have a different treatment plan to treat an area of an individual and it does not mean that one way is necessarily better than the other.</p><p> It is really just up to the judgement of the treating physician to determine the best place to put  the applicators and which sizes to use.  Without examining you, it is impossible to give you specific advice as to whether treating just the middle or the sides might give you a better result one way or the other. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting can be overlapped by 50%. A provider determines how many areas are needed depending on how much fat is there and how the orientation of the fat is. Multiple treatments can be done safely but those areas will feel sore.</p><p>You always have the choice to break up the treatments and you won’t look lopsided in anyway. CoolSculpting results are very gradual. If you still have questions about your treatment then follow up with your doctor and be sure you two are on the same page. (Robert G. Aycock, MD, FACS, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Coolsculpting for fat reduction</h3><p>Coolsculpting has been proven to work for modest reduction in fat. Going to a Coolsculpting physician and having your questions answered in person as well as being examined is most important. (Francisco Canales, MD, Santa Rosa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Fat is slowly eliminated over a 3 month period but would not be detectable in your urine.  Breakdown of the fat cells usually occurs within the first month and it takes about 3 months to see your final results.</p><p> As your swelling resolves after several weeks you will slowly start to see the changes.  (Peter Hyans, MD, Summit Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It can take 3 months to see the effect after a CoolSculpting treatment.  I would say the soonest that you might start to see some improvement would be about a month.  The fat cells that are destroyed in the treatment process are disposed of by the body’s lymphatic system.</p><p> The fat would not show up in the urine, so ketone strips would not be useful.  (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting is a great procedure where you gradually have the fat excreted from the body. Ketone strips cannot detect it.  (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p></div>
