<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h4>Pain Resolves Usually In 2-3 Days Following CoolSculpting </h4><p>It’s not unusual for patients to experience some pain following abdominal coolsculpting. This pain is often described as dull and achy and typically improves in 2-3 days. </p><p>Rarely the pain is more severe and is characterized as sharp and stabbing. The origin, of this pain is unclear, but is probably related to traction on the soft tissue related to suction from the applicator device. It seems to be more common when the large applicator head is used.</p><p>The pain usually resolves spontaneously without treatment in 1 to 2 weeks, but occasionally may be present for 4-6 weeks. Occasionally non- steroidal inflammatory agents such as Aleve and Motrin can be used to minimize pain. Rarely narcotics may be necessary as well. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)<br>
In a small subset of patients pain may occur that is characterized as uncomfortable and crampy. The pain may last for 4-6 weeks. We often prescribe a topical analgesic patch to ameliorate this. (Steven Hacker, MD, West Palm Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>There is a small number of patients who under go Coolsculpting, especially when the large treatment head is used, who experience pain after the procedure. This seems to occur in about 10% of these patients. It will usually subside in a few days, however may last a few weeks.</p><p>Patients who have previously had liposuction have stated that this pain was not as bad as liposuction pain, but it still hurts. Talk with your doctor. Prescription pain medication is an option if ibuprofen isn’t adequate. (Daniel P. Markmann, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)<br>
<em>Pain After Coolsculpting</em></p><p>Patients can experience pain in the area treated (more likely when the abdomen is treated) for the first 2-3 weeks. Normally, this pain will subside on it’s own with time. We recommend that patients take ibuprofen to help with the discomfort but it may be best for you to contact the office where you had treatment to see what they recommend. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Pain, tenderness, tingling, discomfort are all common, normal side effects after CoolSculpting. Motrin or Aleve can help with swelling and some of the pain. I would recommend contacting your provider to see if they can write you a prescription for Lyrica or Lidoderm Lidocaine Patches to help with the pain.</p><p>Both of these medications are frequently used to help with the symptoms you are presenting. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div><h5>Coolsculpting Pain & Healing</h5><p>Post treatment pain typically resolves within one week post treatment-one week after it onsets. Try applying ice packs and please refer back to your treating physician/clinic so they may determine whether a prescription remedy would help you here. (Edward Stokes, MD, West Hollywood Physician)</p><p><em>Pain after CoolSculpting</em></p><p>In a very small percentage of patients, they may experience some nerve pain after a few days. This is very different from the small discomfort they feel when having the treatment performed. In these cases, we prescribe Neurontin which is very helpful in alleviating this pain in a few days.</p><p>In providing over 2000 treatments we find this happens on occasion and is not the typical side effect. This can happen more when the larger hand piece is used vs the regular (smaller) hand pieces. (Emerico Csepanyi, MD, Newport Beach Physician)<br>
<em>Pain with Coolsculpting</em></p><p>Anytime pain is continue to escalate and is getting to the point of being unbearable it is best to contact the treating physician for an exam and medication to help deal with this discomfort. (Michelle Ellern, DO, Livingston Physician)</p><p>Some degree of pain and discomfort is completely normal after a CoolSculpting treatment. Sometimes patients can experience nerve pain, which sounds like what you may be experiencing. This can last anywhere from 5-14 days. A conservative approach to manage your discomfort would be to wear some type of compression undergarment such as Spanx and/or taking over the counter pain relievers.</p><p>If the discomfort is not manageable, you should contact your practitioner. A medication such as neurontin can be prescribed to reduce the nerve pain associated with the treatment. This medication can have some side effects, such as drowsiness, so check with your practitioner to make sure this would be an appropriate medication for you to take. (John Diaz, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)<br>
<strong>CoolSculpting – Post Treatment Pain </strong></p><p>The feeling of broken glass may be experienced 2-5 days following the Coolsculpting procedure. We refer to this as late onset pain. The good news is that this is a rare side effect and does not happen to everyone.</p><p>Unfortunately we cannot predict who will or won’t experience it. This pain consists of sharp intermittent pains that can be very uncomfortable. At our Clinic clients are invited to contact me to discuss pain management options. (Shehla Ebrahim, MD, Vancouver Physician)</p><p><strong>When Does the Excrutiating Pain Subside After CoolSculpting?</strong></p><p>It is common to have onset pain after this procedure. It typically starts around 5 days after the procedure and may last several days. I recommend contacting the office where you had your procedure performed and they can discuss pain management options with you.<br>
It will eventually subside and you should be very pleased with your results. (Brian C. Reuben, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Post procedure pain can vary markedly from one patient to the next. For those patients who have significant pain we recommend 600 mg-800 mg of ibuprofen every 8 hours. Intense pain can persist for up to 4 weeks although usually resolves within 1-2 weeks.</p><p>On a rare occasions, patients may need a prescription medication to help reduce the pain. You should call the office that did the procedure and ask them what they recommend for treatment of the pain.</p><p>They should be able to give you guidance on how to address the pain. Some patients have found Spanks or other very tight compressive clothing to be comforting during the first couple of weeks following the procedure. (Teresa Mann, MD, Bozeman Dermatologist)<br>

</div>Most patients do not have any unmanageable discomfort post coolsculpting treatment. There is a small percentage of patients (generally less than 5 percent) who have significant discomfort or pain. Some of these cases are with patients who have a medical condition that is contraindicated for   In the cases with pain, the pain can generally be managed.
<p>In almost all cases, pain fades after 4 to 6 weeks. Contact your treating physician to alert him or her of your pain, and ask to be seen. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Pain is typical with the application, and rarely with the removal of the applicatory of CoolSculpting. Skin sensitivity can occur for a few weeks on the skin in regional areas. If it is specifically the belly button (umbilicus) make sure with your doctor that there is no umbilical hernia present. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)<br>

</div>
<strong>When Does the Excruciating Pain Subside After CoolSculpting?</strong><p>The possibility of delayed onset pain that can occur a few days after a CoolSculpting treatment of the abdominal area is caused by the nerve endings defrosting. The pain can last between 1 to 10 days. Most patients find comfort by applying ice on the area or taking a oral nerve medication called Neurontin prescribed by your physician. (Daniel Taheri, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting Discomfort</i></p><p>Not everyone experiences excruciating pain after treatment. However, if this happens it is usually right after the treatment ends and usually last approximately 10 minutes. (David L. Robbins, MD, FACS, West Des Moines Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Pain post treatment is definitely normal, especially if the larger hand piece was used. Sometimes patients find relief with some compression in the treated area, taking over the counter pain medication, cool compresses, and wearing loose, comfortable clothing that does not irritate the treated area.</p><p>If your pain persists, your provider can give you a prescription medication that can relieve the discomfort. The discomfort that can occur with the larger hand piece is normally due to nerve pain. The nerves can be stretched during the treatment, therefore causing some pain.</p><p>There is medication that can be taken and it will gradually begin working to relieve your pain once you start taking it. Most discomfort resolves with a couple of weeks. (Steven H. Williams, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
