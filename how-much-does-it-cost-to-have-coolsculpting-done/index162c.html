<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Coolsculpting is a great way to change the shape of your body without surgery.</p><p>This treatment has been around since 2009 and is actually becoming more popular after all this time for a couple reasons.</p><p>One reason for it’s increasing popularity is because it really works! The other reason is because the company has developed several new applicator sizes and shapes which is allowing for treatments in additional areas possible.</p><p>Because of the new hand pieces, we are now able to truly design a plan for a transformation of your body that has not been possible without liposuction in the past.</p><p>The cost of the treatment to transformation is really dependent on your goals.</p><p>Many people do several areas to achieve there optimal results. Typically the more treatments you commit to, the better your result with be and better pricing is available with packages.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_45" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>That being said, people typically spend between $2000-5000 for this treatment. (Quenby Erickson, DO, FAAD, FACMS, Chicago Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>CoolSculpting by Zeltiq Cost</h4><p>The cost of your CoolSculpting treatment varies from about $650 to $800 per session. The exact cost will depend on your individualized treatment plan specific to your body type and physical assessment. (Louis P. Bucky, MD, Philadelphia Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting is very cost effective for a permanent result! Typical pricing within our CoolSpa generally starts around $700+ but we frequently offer additional discounts throughout the year and also offer dualsculpting.</p><p>Only an evaluation with one of our skilled technicians can determine if you are an ideal candidate for the Coolsculpting procedure and the exact total cost.</p><p>All of our consultations are complimentary and take about 30 minutes. (Joseph G. Bauer, MD, FACS, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Coolsculpting cost in San Diego</h4><p>Coolsculpting or cryolipolysis, involves freezing unwanted to fat to destroy fat cells without surgery. Cost may vary from $600 to $750 per area. It is best to seek out a reputable center with an on-site cosmetic surgeon or dermatologist medical director, and where the staff is well trained.</p><p>Our staff in San Diego are certified by Coolsculpting University. (Roy A. David, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>CoolSculpting Prices</h5><p>CoolSculpting treatments typically start at $700, and our practice does exercise package pricing for multiple treatments and we do occasionally offer special pricing in our monthly emails. Zeltiq does control pricing to a certain degree, so exercise caution if a company advertises rates that seem lower than other reputable locations.</p><p>Be sure your treatment will be performed by someone who is experience, has attended CoolSculpting University, and is supervised by a board certified plastic surgeon. (Thomas McFadden, MD, Greenville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Cool sculpting price</h4><p>the price of cool sculpting is individualized. It depends on the areas that are being treated and the amount of tissue that needs to be treated. It also depends on how dramatic of a result the patient is looking for.</p><p>The cost per treatment is the same regardless of which provider you to go to. (Chad K. Wheeler, MD, Spokane Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of cool sculpting</h3><p>The cost for this procedure really depends upon the number of treatment areas which you want treated. This is because the device grasps a limited area of skin and fat with each one hour treatment session.</p><p>For smaller areas, the cost is about $600-700 and for larger areas it is about $1000. See a board certified plastic surgeon for a consult. (Richard Chaffoo, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting costs</strong></p><p>Cost depends on where you are in the country. Typically people buy at least two sites (or one large site). Price of this ranges $1200-$1400. Most people do not get just one small. Depending on how many areas you want to treat determines the total cost.</p><p>And whether you want to do two cycles or one. The cost can range $1200-$4000, but since Coolscultping is purchase by site, individual patients plans vary. The great thing is you can buy as much or as little as you want Making cost flexible for the patient.</p><p>You could split up treatments according to your budget. This makes it easier to afford than other modalities which require purchase all at once. (Burton M. Sundin, MD, Richmond Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Cool Sculpting Auburn AL</em></p><p>Cool Sculpting is a non-invasive fat reduction treatment. The price varies based on how many treatments you buy at a time. The price will vary from $600 to $700 per treatment for the smaller applicators and $1,200 to $1,300 for the larger applicator.</p><p>Multiple treatments are required for optimal results. (Ralph Trey Aquadro, MD, Auburn Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting is priced per treatment area. In my office, patients have the option of purchasing specific areas or they can purchase packages of treatments. In the case of a package purchase, the price is significantly discounted.</p><p>Purchasing specific areas will cost $750 per area. A package of 4 cycles costs $2500, 6 cycles is $4000, and 10 cycles is $5000. (Michael E. Ciaravino, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Costs vary depending on what area is being treated as well as how many cycles are used per treatment. We charge $675 per cycle but most treatments require 2 or more cycles. We also offer package pricing when four cycles or more are purchased.</p><p>Exact pricing will be given to you during your complimentary consultation. (Lenore Sikorski, MD, Orange County Dermatologist)</p><p><strong>How Much Does CoolSculpting by Zeltiq Cost?</strong></p><p>Coolsculpting costs vary based on how much needs to be done. There is a fee per “cycle,” and this cycle treats one area at a time.</p><p>If you go to a reputable provider, they will teach you the new concept of treat to transformation which means they will come up with a treatment plan that will provide the maximum benefits by utilizing various-size treatment heads to the areas and making sure the maximum gets done to make the areas look the best they can be.</p><p>Don’t be fooled by gimmick pricing — make sure the provider is skilled in fat removal and CoolSculpting in particular. (Michael Gold, MD, Nashville Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Always depends on how many areas you want addressed. The cost can vary from around $1500-$7500. Best is an in-office examination so all your questions can be answered. (Francisco Canales, MD, Santa Rosa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Prices vary depending on the area that is being treated. There are different size applicators that are used to treat different areas of the body. Typically the price range for a treatment would be $600 to $1500.00, depending on the area and if you are having multiple areas treated at one session. We recommend coming in for a complimentary consultation so that we can size the applicators with your body type to give an exact price. (R. Scott Yarish, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Cost of CoolSculpting in New York</i></p><p>The cost of CoolSculpting is quite uniform and tends to range from $ 600 to $ 800 per treatment cycle. The more cycles performed as part of package, the lower the cost. The hand piece size also factors in.</p><p>The smaller and medium ones cost less and the larger and the new CoolSmooth (for outer thighs) costs more. If you see prices for less than $ 600 per cycle you should become concerned that the provider is using fake CoolSculpting.</p><p>This is becoming more of a problem. Most of these devices are manufactured in China. (Ran Y. Rubinstein, MD, Manhattan Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting Pricing</strong></p><p>CoolSculpting pricing will vary office to office but I can provide you with information about how it is that we price CoolSculpting in our nonsurgical beauty boutique: CoolSculpting is charged by the area.</p><p>We have 7 different CoolSculpting applicators including the CoolFit, CoolCurve+, CoolCore, CoolSmooth, and CoolMax.</p><p>For the smaller applicators meaning all but the CoolMax, and CoolSmooth we call two small applicators one treatment area. For the larger applicators like the CoolMax and CoolSmooth one applicator is equal to one area.</p><p>We charge $1,650.00 for the first treatment of one area. (again two smalls or one large applicator = 1 applicator)</p><p>We recommend that patients receive two treatments per treated area and offer a significant second treatment discount. So for the second treatment of one area we charge $550.00.</p><p>The idea is that for $1,650.00 you will receive up to a 20% reduction in the fat layer but by adding an additional $550.00 you can receive up to a 50% reduction in the fat layer. The consultation then obviously becomes extremely important to the pricing and the result.</p><p>There are further discounts as you add more areas and or if you have previously had surgery with me. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
