<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>– I am on day 8 after coolsculpting. I was prescribed neurontin and I’ve been taking it before bed for 3 days now. It hasn’t worked at all. I had some codiene left from my tubal ligation (which all I needed was regular Tylenol for). The codiene has been a life saver. The pain is still there, but very dull.</p><p>– Day 7 after coolsculpting had two large lower done and then 4 days ago had two small upper. The pain is horrible and agree with comments that consultants are not forthcoming regarding the pain. I have not been able to put on jeans in a week. I think I may call for pain meds.</p><p>– I’m on day 4 and I’m still sore and numb. I had my upper abs done. Didn’t need to take meds so far. The itching is making me crazy and I’m trying to relief it with the use of ice packs. I will wait the 2 months to check the results and only then have the lower abdomen done.<br>

</div>– In my consultation, I asked about the pain and was told that only happens when you use the large device, not the small one. 11 days ago I had 3 sections coolsculpting done (lower abdomen and each side of my waist) with the small device. True to the brochure, the procedure was fairly painless. After an initial discomfort, the area was numb for the remaining 50 minutes before the 5-minute massage, which was painful. I thought the worst was over. Not So. I have a high-pain tolerance and have given birth to two large babies without an epidural, but the recovery from CoolSculpting has been the most painful experience of my life. Not only did I swell up the first 3 days so that I could not wear pants or underwear, but although numb on the outside, I felt like I had been beaten with a bat on the inside. I could not sleep or sit upright, and Tylenol 3 did not help. About Day 5, the “zaps” started which must be what the nerve pain with shingles feels like. Just when I thought I had really damaged myself, on Day 9, I started feeling more normal. Almost all the bloating is down and I can sleep, and it only hurts when I press on it. I haven’t seen one bit of slimming, and hope that I didn’t get completely suckered by spending all this morning to feel such pain without any result. I would not recommend this to anyone.<br><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_489" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div>– For me, the nerve pain fade out completely at the end of week 2. I’m at week 3 and I almost have no numbness on my belly. I still feel some sore spots when I press it. And I can see a slight difference in my fat tissue when i sit (belly roll).
<p>– For me, the nerve pain fade out completely at the end of week 2. I’m at week 3 and I almost have no numbness on my belly. I still feel some sore spots when I press it. And I can see a slight difference in my fat tissue when i sit (belly roll).</p><p>– 5 days of stabbing, sharp, burning pain!</p><p>– Even on line are saying only two or three days but everyone I talk to are saying it took weeks.<br>
– Sad to say, but my husband is suffering pain from it almost 8 months now, somedays is really hard to believe that one day the nightmare will finish 🙁</p><p>– I had coolsculpting done large device on my lower abs 4 weeks ago and the pain and swelling are just starting to subside. No one told me that I would be bigger after this procedure due to swelling and bruising and sadly my doctors office dropped the ball and had a new nurse respond to my call ref my pain and inform me no one has this reaction and they don’t fill prescriptions for pain patches just take advil. I have been toughing it out but for 750 what a waste of money . It has been r 4 weeks I’m still having discomfort and am bigger in the stomach than before the procedure. I am supposed to go back in 4 weeks for a second treatment on abs using the smaller device in criss cross pattern I don’t think so…Im just hoping to be healed and not s bloated by then.</p><p>– It’s been more than a week since my procedure, I cannot sleep, the pain is horrible. Please this treatment is a scam. Do go for it! To much pain and its not worth the money , for only 25% fat removal.</p><p>– I had 2 sides of lower abdomen done with the small applicator. On Day 3 the crazy jabbing pains started but ice packs helped and I was fine by Day 7. Just had it again on the same areas with small applicator and the pain has been much worse and I am in Day 7 and it hasn’t gone away. Have taken Aleve and used lidocaine cream and ice packs. I am thin and only have a small pooch so if 4 treatments doesn’t make a noticeable difference, then CoolSculpting does not work.<br>
– I had my stomach, love handles, and arms done last week. The procedures themselves were not bad, I watched shows on my iPad and even slept some. The day after my abdomen was done, it was so swollen I felt like I had a basketball under my shirt. My arms felt like elephant arms. The love handles really were the least sensitive. Now it has been a week since my stomach was done, and I have been having shooting pains which have interfered with sleep. Not quite a week since my arms, but I am experiencing shooting pains there too. The pain is more noticeable when I am not busy…such as watching TV, or sleeping. When I’m out and about, I don’t really notice. I’ve been taking Tylenol (which seems to work well) and on occasion I take some oxycodone that I had left over from a dental procedure. I’m really hoping the pains will subside soon…definitely am not going to panic about the pain, I think dwelling on it makes it worse.<br>
It’s been 3 weeks, and my stomach and love handles are fine now. The stomach is still a little numb, but no pain. HOWEVER…my arms are still SO sore!!! They feel very weird and numb yet painful at the same time. I’m sure hoping that the results are worth it!</p><p>– I had coolsculpting done 3 days ago – two treatments on my abdomen with the small applicators. The first 10 minutes or so were very painful, then it settled down, but the massage at the end of each treatment was extremely painful. The nurse said that I had a ‘good brick’ which was apparently a good thing … but it meant that she had to really work it down … ouch! 3 days in and I am still in severe pain and very swollen. I feel like I’ve been smacked with a paddle then dragged along the road on my belly!! The nerve pain hasn’t started yet and I dread when it does because it sounds like it’s going to be worse than what I’m going through now. Right now I am regretting this procedure … but if it’s a remarkable result maybe I will be able to forget. I agree with lots of other comments here … the clinic played down the after effects. They suggested spanks, ice and tylenol though if it gets painful. So far I have been doing all three and still in lots of pain. I tend to think I tolerate pain well … maybe not so well any more!</p><p>– I am on day six and had Coolsculpting of the lower abs the small applicator two sections. I have been swollen and my belly is very tender to the touch – last night I got the shooting pains – it woke me from my sleep and I could not go back to bed – I am just wondering how long this will last?</p><p>– I’ve had several discussions with my provider and read through various postings before my coolsculpting procedure everything that’s been communicated verbally and in text was how “minimal” the discomfort will be and the very short duration in which you will feel it. I had the procedure done 8 days ago and my experiences immediately after the procedure were “spot on” all that I’d expected. I didn’t even feel the need for them to write me a script because I was feeling fine and could tolerate the what was once ” minimal” discomfort. I did understand that the most frequent complaint of post procedure discomfort seemed to be with patients who had the larger applicators used during the procedure . I’d started massaging my abs frequently to help reduce the tightness and numbness and it seemed to work fine. Well 4 or 5 days post procedure and ..OMG iiiiish hit the fan! I’m itching, stinging, burning and unable to sleep! I called my provider and they prescribed the Neurotin (which is NO GOOD in my book) and suggested I continue with massage and do warm compresses. I will say the compresses have helped somewhat, but it’s a pain to keep getting up warming a cloth several times a day. It’s almost unbearable to touch my abs let alone give the “kneaded” style massage I’d been doing repeatedly. I’ve looked up articles several days now and I’m reading posts from people who are having the very same problem. Stinging, burning, itching, being abruptly awakened from a good nights sleep. Not to mention NOBODY describes this as merely being “uncomfortable” it’s PAINFUL every way you slice it and quite frankly, the only thing that may actually help it is a controlled substance “oxycodone” or something in the narcotic family. I will say the biggest push for me getting this procedure was I spoke to people who’ve done it and had great results. Another positive is the FDA, while they approve the safety , they can’t approve or guarantee results. Everyone and experience is different and it’s too soon to see any major results so I can’t say it wasn’t with it, but providers should be more transparent about setting expectations and stop “down playing” everything cos this is REAL!</p><p>– I am om day 6 after paying $2100 to do the lower part of my stomach. It seems the price here in Norway is a lot higher than in other places. I spend all day about to cry because of the stabbing,burning pain. I’ve never experienced anything like this. I have not slept since the first night and the nurse at the clink told me to take ibuprofen and paracetamol which does not help at all,not even for a second. I am hoping that I will see some results worth the pain and the money,but I would not recommend this to anyone. They say nothing about the pain,they only say its a small discomfort the first 4-10 minutes…</p><p>– I had Coolsculpting 7 days ago, on my stomach 2 either side and 1 below. The procedure was pretty pain free. 4 days in the pain started, it is incredible. I have itching and stabbing pains with my stomach area being totally numb to touch . I am very, very bloated and it’s hard to the touch, I am unable to move freely. To date I have had 2 days in bed with severe pain and I am unable to sleep. The doctor has just prescribed co-codamol and asprin but this has very little effect. I have just been given Gabapentin with no real improvement. My concern is that this is going to be long lasting as there is absolutely no sign of it abating. I am now much larger than before the treatment and I paid £2000 for 3 areas.</p><p>– I had my stomach done about a month ago, and had the same pain as you describe as well as the bloating…my stomach was huge! It was pretty bad for about 2 weeks. However, now the pain is completely gone and I am actually starting to see results. My stomach is starting to look flatter and I’m down about 1/2 inch from before the procedure. They say it takes 90 days to see the full benefit so I’m looking forward to that. So hang in there, the pain should subside soon.</p><p>– I had the large device 10 weeks ago on my stomach had the same problem. I was huge for 4 weeks before I felt like I was getting back to normal and 8 weeks before I saw a slight result. I only did the one treatment cancelled the 2nd one just the thought of going through that again was nightmare. At least you did all 3 at one time so you will only go through this once and in a few weeks you will probably see a good result. I found the pain patches very effective during my first 2 weeks. Most of the pain subsided by 3 week it was just the swelling which was hard to take but on the start of the 5th week I was able to wear my pants again so hang in there it will go away .</p></div>
