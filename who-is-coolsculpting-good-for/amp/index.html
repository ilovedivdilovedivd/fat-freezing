<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The best way to determine if you a coolsculpting candidate or not is by examination of the area of concern but if you are a good candidate then coolsculpting is very successful in chin area. (Ramandeep Sidhu, MD, Issaquah Vascular Surgeon)</p><h4>CoolMini or Lipo</h4><p>While it’s best to have an in-person examination of the area to determine which procedure would be best for you, there are several options aside from CoolSculpting, such as liposuction or SmartLipo, should you not be a good candidate for CoolSculpting.</p><p>CoolSculpting, being noninvasive, has wonderful results for the right candidates, leaving patients extremely happy.</p><p>I recommend scheduling an in-person consultation with a Board Certified Surgeon in your area to discuss the best surgical options for you.

Reedy, MD, Reading Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3974" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p><strong>CoolSculpting under the chin?</strong></p><p>We would recommend a complimentary consultation to see if you are a candidate for CoolSculplting under the chin or if another treatment would work more effectively, like Kybella.</p><p>In most cases more than one treatment is required to obtain desired results. (Erika Francis, MD, Largo Physician)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting under the chin</i></p><p>I would consider liposuction the gold standard for reduction of fat under the chin. Liposuction can remove the most amount of fat in one session.</p><p>CoolSculpting under the chin can reduce fat, but more than one treatment session is often needed to obtain the desired result. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Can CoolSculpting be performed on the buttocks?</strong></p><p>CoolSculpting can sometimes be performed on the buttocks. It is dependent upon the contour of the bulge and the pliability of the tissue one wants treated. The Zeltiq CoolSculpting device uses an applicator of which there are three different ones.</p><p>The choice of the applicator is dependent upon the contour of the bulge being treated. In addition, the tissue has to be pliable enough so that it can be pulled up into the applicator. One can only tell if your particular area can be treated by examining the area in person.</p><p>I suggest you visit a CoolScupting physician who will be be able to make a more definitive assessment of your desired treatment area. (Ted Brezel, MD, Long Island Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Zeltiq on the buttocks</i></p><p>Coolscultping or zeltiq in certain circumstances can be used on the posterior buttocks or as some people refer to the area as “saddle bags”. It is most important that you be examined first and if appropriate, have the procedure performed by a physician well skilled in this treatment.</p><p>In my experience, those that respond best to the treatment in this area are those with some degree of a fat pocket as well as some laxity, in order for the suction device to attach best to the area. (Lori A. Brightman, MD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Coolscupting can be used on the buttocks</h4><p>Coolsculpting in Europe is used in many different locations, including the buttocks, with great results. As with all procedures, a consultation to make sure that you are a good candidate must occur and the applicator by an experienced person must be measured.</p><p>If the fat area has a good “fit” into the applicator, and it is a discrete area of fat, then the answer would be “yes”. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h5>Liposuction and coolsculpting both reduce fat well but differently in my NYC practice</h5><p>Both liposuction and CoolSculpting reduce fat volume. Ideal patients for both procedures are not obese, but rather have focal areas of fat that they can’t seem to reduce despite exercise and eating a healthy diet.</p><p>The physician can remove fat with liposuction from some areas that CoolSculpting’s applicators won’t fit well. Liposuction often reduces as much fat as the physician and patient desires, but CoolSculpting reduces fat volume dependent on how the body metabolizes the frozen fat cells that die, but in general leaves more fat behind than liposuction.</p><p>Some patients need a second liposuction to finesse certain areas, and many patients are told in consultation that they would probably need two or more CoolSculpting procedures to reduce an ample amount of fat because of their shape.</p><p>Liposuction patients may experience more bruising than that with CoolSculpting. Areas may ooze slightly the first day after liposuction, not with CoolSculpting. Exercise is usually restricted for a couple of days or more after liposuction, but not necessarily with CoolSculpting.</p><p>Focal swelling is present after both procedures but slightly more with liposuction generally. Liposuction is an invasive procedure but CoolSculpting is not. There may be some medical conditions or medications that a patient takes, for which liposuction would not be considered safe to do whereas these limitations are much less with CoolSculpting.</p><p>If there is a signficant volume of fat in one distinct area and the patient desires to see the final result sooner, rather than later, then liposuction might be their choice as it does take a couple to several months to see the result after each CoolSculpting.</p><p>So both patient and physician will have a contribution of the decision-making process when determining if CoolSculpting or liposuction will be done. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Lipo vs. Coolsculpting</em></p><p>Coolsculpting definitely works. If you are close to your ideal body weight and want a moderate improvement of a stubborn area of fat then Coolsculpting may be for you. It decreases fat in the treatment area 15-25% and it takes 2-3 months to appreciate the results.</p><p>Also, there is no down time. Liposuction can remove much more fat and the results are immediate. It is surgery and there is some down time. (Sanjiv Kayastha, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>coolsculpting selectively freezes fat cells to induce programmed cell death. It is a great procedure for the right patient as it does not require surgery or anesthesia. You would benefit from an in person consultation to see if you are a candidate. (Suzanne Kim Doud Galli, MD, PhD, FACS, Washington Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Lipo vs CoolSculpting?</h5><p>They both have benefits and drawbacks. It depends first on several factors, such as the areas being treated, how many there are, and which benefits and drawbacks suit your particular needs.</p><p>For example, cool sculpting has the benefit of no down time, no garment, no surgical procedure with scars, no medications, but you may need 2 or three treatments to reach your goals, and it might end up costing a little more.</p><p>It’s impossible to say that without a consultation. Also, some areas don’t respond well to either one of those techniques, so without an exam and a consultation. I’ve seen areas treated with both get great results in good candidates. (Sofia K. Kirk, MD, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Would it be helpful to wear compression hose after Coolsculpting?</strong></p><p>The swelling is localized to the specific area that was Coolsculpted, therefore compression hose would not be necessary.</p><p>Typically, the swelling is minimal and only lasts for about a week. (Melanie L. Petro, MD, Birmingham Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Compression garments would certainly be helpful to wear post procedure and in some cases, can help reduce swelling. The majority of the swelling takes place during the first 1-5 days, with the swelling tapering down after that. (P. Daniel Ward, MD, Salt Lake City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Compression after coolsculpting is more for personal comfort. It will not affect the results overall but wearing tight garments for few days will help with the discomfort if any. Our clients do tell us that it feels better with compression garment.</p><p>you chose an excellent treatment for unwanted fat. (Ramandeep Sidhu, MD, Issaquah Vascular Surgeon)</p><p>I do not think that it would be helpful to wear compression hose after a CoolSculpting treatment to the abdomen. Patients do not need to wear any compression garment after CoolSculpting and there would not be any expected swelling in the legs after a treatment to the abdomen. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>When CoolSculpting is a Good Option</h4><p>CoolSculpting may be an option for you if you reduce to a weight that your happy with and you still have residual fatty pockets in the abdomen. (Leo Keegan, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Uneven skin after Coolsculpting</b></p><p>You may want to return to the plastic surgeon who did your treatment for possible massage techniques. However, the results take 1-3 months to take effect and the area will most likely even out over time. (Jeffrey E. Schreiber, MD, FACS, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Two weeks too early after CoolSculpting to see the results</b></p><p>It takes time to develope the results after Zeltiq. At least four months to see 20% reduction. Initially there is swelling so it can take much time to see the improvement. Please schedule a followup appointment with your doctor to discuss. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Swelling can be uneven</strong></p><p>at two weeks, you may still have some swelling which may be uneven. don’t fret. it is still quite early and you probably will not see final results until 2-3 months after your procedure. (Eric Chang, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Zeltiq – wait a few months before judging results</b></p><p>Patients typically see noticeable results at 2 months and may experience continued improvement through 4 months. Wait for several months before making any judgments about symmetry.</p><p>If, after several months, you notice that one side is noticeably larger, you may elect to repeat coolscupting on that side. Alternatively, you could elect to have a more customizable treatment with liposuction/laser lipo. (Melissa Chiang, MD, FAAD, Houston Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>It is too early to see the effects of cool sculpting 2 weeks after the procedure: you will likely see improvement an improvement in the area 2 months from now. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Zeltiq Coolsculpting 2 weeks post treatment</strong></p><p>It is still early to see your final outcome. It may take several more weeks before you see your final result. If your stomach was the only region treated (and not the sides) this may result in a less than ideal outcome however.</p><p>The “love handle” region should be treated as well if you look “out of proportion.” This si the same philosophy as with standard liposuction. (Jon E. Mendelsohn, MD, Cincinnati Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Two weeks after Coolsculpting is too soon to judge your results. Be patient as results really start to be seen at 4-8 weeks. After that if still problematic discuss with your doctor. (Steven Hacker, MD, West Palm Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting fat removal is maximum at 2 to 3 months after treatment. </strong></p><p>Coolsculpting fat removal reaches its maximum effect at 2 to 3 months after treatment. Two weeks ago when you had the treatment, a portion of your fat cells suffered permanent damage and are now being removed in a gradual manner by cells called macrophages.</p><p>This process will be complete by two to three months. If at that point you still notice an asymmetry, I recommend you treat the area that is still more prominent with the standard applicator. Remember what this procedure does is precisely sculpting and removing fat with the use of cold. (Leyda Elizabeth Bowes, MD (not practicing), Miami Dermatologic Surgeon)</p></div>
