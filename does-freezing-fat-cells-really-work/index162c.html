<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Absolutely! I believe healthy eating and sustainable exercise, in conjunction with CoolSculpting process, delivers exceptional results. (Louis P. Bucky, MD, Philadelphia Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>It sure works!</h3><p>There is plenty of scientific documentation and they are consistent with the results that we are achieving at Silkwood Medical.</p><p>You can expect roughly 20-25% permanent reduction in fat in the areas treated.</p><p>We are treating upper and lower abdomen, flanks/love handles, hips, inner thighs, saddle bags, upper arms and man boobs. Currently, it is the best non-surgical, permanent fat reduction treatment that is on the market right now.</p><p>We have had this machine for over 1 year now and we are constantly impressed with just how well it works! Clients may start out with a couple of treatments (1 area of their body) to see if it really works and generally they always end up coming back for more and more treatments on other areas of their bodies. (Warwick Nettle, MBBS, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>What to expect from cool sculpting</i></p><p>Cool sculpting works. I have never seen it not work. It reduces the area about 20%. Sometimes Smartlipo is a better alternative.</p><p>You need to ask an expert which would be best for you. (Daryl K. Hoffman, MD, San Jose Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting by Zeltiq</strong></p><p>CoolScupting by Zeltiq is an effective, non-invasive way to lose fat cells in targeted areas. CoolSculpting, unlike liposuction, requires no surgery, no anesthesia and no down time. CoolSculpting technology is FDA approved and proven to eliminate up to 22% of fat cells in the treated area.</p><p>A consultation with your doctor will determine whether or not you are a good candidate for the treatment. (Frank P. Fechner, MD, Worcester Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Does Coolsculpting by Zeltiq work?</h3><p>We are thrilled to offer this procedure because it does work and is permanent. On average we see a 20-25% fat reduction in the area treated. Many patients are happy with the result from one treatment, and others go on for secondary treatment to enjoy a 40-50% reduction in the area.</p><p>It’s important to have a thorough evaluation by a Coolsculpting certified technician to determine if you are a best candidate and have realistic expectations for the procedure. (Joseph G. Bauer, MD, FACS, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Coolsculpting really works</em></p><p>Our San Diego Coolsculpting staff are certified by the manufacturer and consistently achieve great results with this device. We believe coolsculpting is the most reliable non-invasive modality for fat reduction. (Roy A. David, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Does CoolScultping (made by Zeltiq) work?</i></p><p>YES yes yes! It works, without a doubt. Don’t undertreat yourself, though, or you’ll be disappointed. Go to an office that understands the Treatment to Transformation model and will be honest with you about what it will take to get you thrilled with your results. (Carmen Kavali, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Coolsculpting effectiveness</i></p><p>As the first plastic surgeon in the Houston area to bring on Coolsculpting, I have found this solution to be very effective at fat reduction for the right patient. If you have a small pinched area of fat that can be drawn out, then you can expect a 20-25% reduction of that pinched area.</p><p>I have also found that a multi-treatment plan can be more effective and even allow for more reduction. I discuss with my patients different body contouring options and describe the limitations of each. A number will continue with Coolsculpting and others will opt for a surgical solution.</p><p>I would recommend visiting with a board certified plastic surgeon who personally does your consult and has experience planning and treating you for your body contouring concerns. (Young R. Cho, MD, PhD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Does Zeltiq (CoolSculpting) Really Work for Fat Reduction?</em></p><p>In the case of someone who is the ideal candidate for CoolSculpting, yes we have seen great results for fat reduction. CoolSculpting is not for someone who has a significant amount of weight to lose, or for someone with visceral fat. (Thomas McFadden, MD, Greenville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Zeltiq (Coolsculpting) results in 20-25% fat reduction with each treatment</h4><p>Clinical studies and person experiences have proven that Coolsculpting (Zeltiq) results in permanent fat reduction in the treated areas. Each cycle will lead to a decrease of 20-25% in the treated area. Whether you are interested in treating your abdomen, thighs, flanks or love handles, Coolsculpting is a viable liposuction alternative. (Adam J. Mamelak, MD, Austin Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Does it really work</h3><p>Fat cells which are reduced to -10 degrees celsius will induce apoptosis and lead to cell reduction in number through volume reduction. These fat cells which are slated for destruction are removed from the body.</p><p>WIth reduced volume of fat cells the profile of the patient’s abdomen or area treated has less girth and thus has an improved aesthetic look. Consider a plastic surgeon who has the ability to treat you completely if you are not a good candidate for CoolSculpting as you consider your options. (R. Brannon Claytor, MD, FACS, Bryn Mawr Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Not just wishful thinkin!</h4><p>A recent review article, which analyzed over 300 hundred articles on cryolipolysis/Coolsculpting, clearly demonstrated the efficacy of this technique. As always, realistic expectations are the key to happiness. If a patient has appropriate fatty anatomy and is an acceptable candidate, Coolsculpting can deliver 20-25% bulge reduction with each cycle, and even more with additional cycles.</p><p>This is done with no surgical risk or downtime. (David Shuter, MD, Jupiter Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Cool sculpting really works</b></p><p>There have been more than 30 peer reviewed papers on the safety and efficacy of Coolsculpting. The results can be dramatic as long as the expectations are in line with what is consistently delivered by the procedure.</p><p>The treated area will reduce in volume by about 25%. People who are not satisfied with the results generally had expectations that were too high. This procedure allows for visible decreases in the treated areas which takes only about an hour per site with no down time, no anesthetic, and almost no pain. (Chad K. Wheeler, MD, Spokane Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Does Cool Sculpting Really Work?</strong></p><p>The simple answer is yes. This is a safe, effective FDA approved treatment for the non-invasive reduction of unwanted fat in numerous areas of the body. The procedure results in about a 20-25% reduction in fat in areas of the body including the arms, back, flanks, abdomen, and thighs.</p><p>See a board certified plastic surgeon for a consultation and treatment plan. (Richard Chaffoo, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>YES!! Putting all the scientific evidence of CoolSculpting’s effectiveness aside, I continue to be amazed on a daily basis with the results that we are able to achieve with this revolutionary treatment. I have yet to come across another treatment that can reduce fat without the need for anesthesia, incisions, or downtime.</p><p>We have had patients that have gained over 10 lbs since their treatments and have still gotten amazing results! (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><h4>CoolSculpting for Fat Reduction</h4><p>Yes it is effective. On average you get about 25% reduction. For some this is enough. For others surgery would be better. It is a noninvasive way to reduce fat. I have treated over 2000 people and have had an excellent experience.</p><p>Very few people complain that it is ineffective. (Burton M. Sundin, MD, Richmond Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Freezing fat cells absolutely works for fat pad reduction</strong></p><p>There is no doubt that Coolsculpting absolutely works for fat pad reduction. On average, we see 25% reduction in fat pad in area treated in 3-4 months and many cases, we have seen much greater efficacy in 2-3 months.</p><p>The remaining fat pads in areas treated with Coolsculpting would be in less of a position to absorb excess nutrients in case there is weight gain in the future.</p><p>We have also seen patients who undergo Coolsculpting are much more motivated to stay with healthier lifestyles of minimizing carbohydrate intake and working out at least three times a week. (William Ting, MD, Bay Area Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Authentic CoolSculpting Really Gets Rid of Fat</strong></p><p>It sounds like it might be too good to be true – eliminating fat without surgery or downtime, with virtually no pain. But we’ve consistently seen great results with CoolSculpting, and it has an unbeatable track record for eliminating fat in the right patient.</p><p>And that’s really the key. A good candidate for CoolSculpting is someone who is happy with their overall weight but finds that they still have stubborn pockets of unwanted fat that don’t respond to diet or exercise.</p><p>Freezing fat cells is not a weight loss treatment. (Frank Lista, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Does freezing fat cells by Coolsculpting work for fat reduction?</i></p><p>Yes, Coolsculpting does work and can lead to permanent (though modest) fat reduction. Consult at a certified Coolsculpting center. You can Google the Coolsculpting by Zeltiq website. Below is a result a patient who had Coolsculpting to the love handle area. (Heather J. Furnas, MD, Santa Rosa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Yes! Freezing fat cells Works</i></p><p>Yes, it absolutely does. We frequently achieve 20% reduction of a fat bulge in our patients. However, you must still watch your diet and exercise in order to maintain results over time. (Lenore Sikorski, MD, Orange County Dermatologist)</p><h4>Coolsculpting delivers consistent 20-25% fat reduction in each treatment area with proper technique and patient selection</h4><p>Coolsculpting offers the most exciting and dependable alternative to more invasive fat reduction technologies like all forms of liposuction. Your optimal results are dependent on proper patient selection, application technique and the expertise of the technician.</p><p>More progressive “off label” techniques that incorporate “stacking” or using an overlap in successive treatments can yield dramatically improved results with patients that have less “pinchable” fatty tissue. We have 2 machines to offer our patients a more efficient time frame for treatment.</p><p>Jeannel Astarita is our Coolsculpting expert at Chelsea Eye and Cosmetic Surgery in addition to being a national educator for Coolsculpting. Patients who are not ideal candidates are evaluated by our board certified plastic surgeon, Dr Elan Singer, for alternative solutions such as ThermiTight, Laser Liposuction, traditional liposuction and abdominoplasty.</p><p>Be sure to seek out a provider in your area that offers employs highly skilled practitioners and a variety of the best tools available to make sure your individual needs are being met. (Joseph A. Eviatar, MD, FACS, New York Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p></div>
