<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><strong>Treatment of thighs with CoolSculpting</strong></p><p>The most common areas treated with CoolSculpting on the thigh are the inner and outer thighs. While it may be possible to treat other parts of the thigh, you would need to be examined to determine if that might be possible. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In our practice, we’ve successfully treated the thighs with CoolSculpting for a large number of women and men up to this point.</p><p>The inner thigh and the outer thigh in particular tend to do very well in my experience, and the results are very gratifying for a non-surgical / non-invasive procedure. (Reza Momeni, MD FACS, Summit Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Coolsculpting Thighs</em></p><p>Coolsculpting can be performed on the inner and outer thighs. There are special applicators for these areas.</p><p>The one for the inner thighs is called CoolFit and the outer thigh one is CoolSmooth. It may be possible to treat the front and back of the thighs.</p><p>Consult with a physician who regularly performs cool sculpting in person to find out what treatments might be good for you. (Sanjiv Kayastha, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting of inner thighs</em></p><p>The contour of the CoolMax applicator is such that it would not create a tight seal on the skin of the inner thighs and the skin would not be pulled into the applicator for treatment.</p><p>It also does not have the proper contour to prevent irregularities after treatment of the inner thighs. The CoolFit applicator is perfect for this area, however. (Sheryl D. Clark, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h3>Using CoolMax Applicator On The Inner Thighs</h3><p>Usually the contour of the CoolMax applicator is such that it does not provide an adequate seal if you try to use it on the inner thighs.</p><p>There is an applicator called the CoolFit applicator which fits perfectly in the thigh area and is the most commonly used applicator for the inner thighs.</p><p>Make sure you see an experienced CoolSculpting provider for an in-person consultation and evaluation. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><h5>Can the coolmax applicator be used on inner thighs?</h5><p>The applicator used for a particular area is determined by its “fit”. There must be a good seal on the applicator in order for the treatment to work.</p><p>During your consultation, templates should be used on each of the areas to be treated in order to determine which applicators will be used. (Nicholas Tarola, MD, Nashville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>CoolMax Applicator</h4><p>The CoolMax applicator is best used in the abdominal area where there may be a lot of tissue needing debulking, whereas the CoolFit was designed for use in long narrow areas such as the inner thighs.</p><p>That being said, some of the applicators may be used in different anatomical areas so long as they fit the treatment area and are not going to create a large contour irregularity.</p><p>I would recommend seeing a plastic surgeon who performs CoolSculpting as they will be able to evaluate you in person and not only provide you with non-surgical, but also with surgical treatment options for your body type. (David A. Sieber, MD, San Francisco Physician)</p><p><em>Inner thighs and CoolSculpting</em></p><p>Generally speaking the Cool Max was not designed for the inner thigh area. You are correct regarding its purpose for “debulking” however its design is ideally suited for the abdominal area. The Cool Fit is designed for use in the inner thigh.</p><p>It is important to have your evaluation and treatment by a person experienced in CoolSculpting as well as having attended “Cool Sculpting University” which is a two day course sponsored by Zeltiq (The inventors of Cool Sculpting) covering all aspects of the evaluation/treatment process.</p><p>Additionally Cool Sculpting is not designed for circumferential fat reduction of the thigh, only the inner thigh. If this is attempted with CoolSculpting you are not likely to be happy with the results and may appear to have many divots and irregularities resembling “shark bites”. (Paul Pietro, MD, Greenville Physician)</p><h4>CoolSculpting to thighs after pregnancy</h4><p>It is safe for you to get CoolSculpting on the thighs at this point after your C-section. The surgery on the abdomen should have no bearing on the thighs. (Shaun Patel, MD, Miami Physician)</p><h3>Treating inner thighs in 64 year old</h3><p>Results should be similar as a younger patient. Loose skin has never been worsened in my patients with this procedure. It won’t make loose skin better. RF is needed for that.</p><p>Cooladvantage and Z Wave get better results. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is impossible to tell from a person’s age if they are a good candidate as the stubborn fat needs to be evaluated. CoolSculpting does not cause skin to sag.</p><p>However, if there is already laxity (loose skin) present then there is a possibility that after the fat has been reduced, the skin appears more loose.</p><p>This conversation is indeed an important one and should be had with the physician and CoolSculpting technician you see in consultation. (Manish Khanna, MD, FRCP(C), Montreal Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting only reduces the fat in the treatment area by approximately 25% so the skin doesn’t become lose. If the overlying skin is to loose to begin with I would let your know after an examination. (Robert Whitfield, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Coolsculpting for the legs</h5><p>Coolsculpting can certainly be performed on legs and knees if you are a suitable candidate. Your Coolsculpting technician will examine your legs, essentially pinch and grab the area you are looking to treat and will determine if that desired area is suitable for the treatment.</p><p>There are various adaptors ranging in size and shape that can be applied to fit the structures of the legs and knees. With that said, in order to respond favourably to the treatment, the area being treated must be fatty tissue.</p><p>There are other structures that make an area fuller such as muscle and thick skin. (Philip Solomon, MD, FRCS, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Is CoolSculpting possible on front sides of legs and beside the knees?</em></p><p>CoolSculpting can possibly be used to treat areas on the legs and knees, but an examination would be needed to determine if you might be a good candidate for the treatment or not. Sometimes, areas on the legs or around the knees may not have much fat, but other tissue causing them to appear larger than desired.</p><p>I would consult with a CoolSculpting physician to see if the treatment might be beneficial to you. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting for Legs, Thighs, Knees, and Calves. </em></p><p>The good news is that CoolSculpting can be done in a variety of places where fat cells tend to build up, and this includes the lower half of the body.</p><p>Many patients that receive treatment at PlatinumCare LA ask for the procedure and treatment on their thighs, the fat around their knees, and near the calf region.</p><p>Wherever there is fat, CoolSculpting can help! (Vinay Aggarwal, MD, Los Angeles Physician)</p><p>Before performing a treatment you would need to clarify the desired treatment areas . It can NOT be done on the legs ( below the knees to the ankle) , but you can do it on the thighs.</p><p>The front of the thighs is not recommended in a way that circumferential liposuction would be performed , coolsculpting can reduce fat on the outer and inner thighs but not recommended for the front/back of the thighs unless you have money to spend and expect little to no return.</p><p>The inner portion of the knees can be treated if there is good quality of fat which can be determined in consultation. (Drew Varano, MD, Washington DC Physician)</p></div>
