<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><em>Coolsculpting really works and patients see a reduction in fat on their neck, arms, tummy, flanks, and thighs.</em></p><p>Coolsculpting is a extremely effective non invasive procedure that predictably reduces the fat thickness of your arms, tummy, flanks, and thighs.</p><p>With the newest Coolsculpting advantage applicators, the treatment times have been reduced to 35 minutes for the 6 inch applicators (Cooladvantage with several different contours) and 5 inch applicators (Cooladvantage Petite) that are just as effective in half the cooling time.</p><p>We are seeing much less post treatment sensory changes and complaints. In my practice, at Casas Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, I examine every coolsculpting patient and mark the area(s) to be treated. My superb staff, actually performs the treatments.</p><p>After 6-8 weeks, I examine the coolsculpting patients and together we evaluate the results in person and with photographs to decide if a second treatment will be needed to achieve the desired result. . (Laurie A. Casas, MD, FACS, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting Does Work</i></p><p>CoolSculpting is FDA-cleared for stubborn pockets of fat on the abdomen, flanks, inner/outer thighs, double-chin and upper arms that are not responsive to diet and exercise. Although liposuction is an effective option for removal of unwanted fat, CoolSculpting is an alternative that involves no surgery or recovery time and is focused on smaller fatty areas.</p><p>CoolSculpting uses innovative cooling technology developed at Harvard University to freeze fat cells without harming the surrounding skin. Your body then gradually eliminates the frozen fat cells. There have been more than 5 million CoolSculpting treatments performed worldwide for nonsurgical fat reduction.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_687" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Patients typically wait 2-3 months between treatment sessions. (Paul M. Friedman, MD, Houston Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>If you can pinch it, you typically can coolsculpt it</h3><p>Coolsculpting can now be used for the outer thighs, chin, abdomen, flanks, bra roll, arms, and inner thigh. We have been coolsculpting since 2011. Several family members and friends have had the procedure done. We have been very happy with the results as have our patients.</p><p>About 5-10% of the patients we see could do coolsculpting but it would not make sense financially when surgical options could deliver 2 to 3 times the outcome at the same or less cost. I would visit with a plastic surgeon if you are more than 20lbs above your ideal body weight to make sure all options are presented to you. (Pramit Malhotra, MD, Ann Arbor Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_688" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h4>CoolSculpting: It’s Not for Everyone</h4><p>CoolSculpting is not nearly as effective as the groundbreaking treatment, SculpSure.</p><p>Using its advanced light-based laser technology, SculpSure is a non-invasive body contouring system that can eliminate up to 24% of stubborn fat in popular areas of the body such as the upper and lower abdomen, back, flanks, thighs and under the chin.</p><p>SculpSure is ideal for all skin and body types and upon consultation with your provider, treatment plans are customized to your aesthetic needs.</p><p>While CoolSculpting treatments may take 60-90 minutes per treatment, each SculpSure treatment only takes 25 minutes and there is no downtime! CoolSculpting can also be extremely painful and leave you with prolonged numbness, while SculpSure uses heat technology for a painless and relaxing experience.</p><p>With SculpSure, most patients see maximum results following a series of treatments. Be sure to ask your SculpSure provider about which treatment plan is right for you. (Kian Karimi, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>For the right candidate, CoolSculpting is a very effective treatment for fat reduction in stubborn areas such as the abdomen, hips, thighs, arms, back fat, bra fat, under the chin, etc. The treatment uses controlled cooling to kill fat cells in the targeted area.</p><p>Over a period of weeks, the body eliminates the fat cells forever. The average patient can expect to see a 20-25% reduction of fat in the treated area. Results can be seen as early as three weeks, but can take up to 3 months for the full result to be visible.</p><p>Additional treatments can be performed if necessary to achieve the desired result. It is best to wait a period of 3 months after your treatment to determine if another session is needed. (Shamim Shakibai, MD, Los Angeles Physician)</p><p>Yes, it really does works! As a CoolSculpting certified doctor who performs a high volume of CoolSculpting treatments, I can tell you first hand that it works as long as the patient is an ideal candidate.</p><p>The treatment is not for individuals who are using it as a means for weight loss. It will also not address skin laxity. Patients who are close to their ideal weight, and have fat that is resistant to their best diet and exercise efforts, typically see the best results.</p><p>Approx. 20%-25% of fat cells are destroyed during a CoolSculpting treatment om thighs. This fat is naturally eliminated through the body and will never return.</p><p>I recommend seeking out a CoolSculpting provider who performs many treatments each week and has been trained by the CoolSculpting University. (Vinay Aggarwal, MD, Los Angeles Physician)</p><h4>CoolSculpting is a proven fat loss procedure</h4><p>Yes, CoolSculpting is proven to reduce subcutaneous fat cells in the treated area, especially on thighs, and these fat cells are gone for good. It reduces fat by 20-25% per treatment, which depending on the amount of fat you begin with, can have a great visual impact, and help to smooth bulges and bumps from problem areas.</p><p>That said, several factors will determine if you are a candidate for the procedure, including your body mass index (BMI), skin elasticity, and the ability of the handpiece to properly “capture” the fat in order to treat it.</p><p>I would suggest you have a consultation with a CoolSculpting provider in your area to determine if you are a good candidate. While individual results will vary, we have seen excellent fat reduction in our patients using CoolSculpting. (Jia Zheng, MD, Vancouver Physician)</p><h4>Technology in Fat Reduction</h4><p>Coolsculpting does really work. It removes around 22% of fat in an area per treatment. However, there is newer technology, called Sculpsure, that achieves what Coolsculpting achieves but without the pain associated with thawing the area out.</p><p>A Sculpsure treatment is also faster and is able to be more customized to the individual. It’s great news that there are newer options available. (Jeffrey T. Camp, MD, Truckee Physician)</p><p><em>Does Coolsculpting really work?</em></p><p>Coolsculpting is absolutely a favorite procedure in our clinic because of the great results so many clients have seen.</p><p>However, some may not be a good candidate for this treatment. Here are a few things one should consider about Coolsculpting: The ideal candidate is someone who is in general good health, maintains a health conscious lifestyle with regular exercise.</p><p>One who has a very distinct pocket of stubborn fat that they feel with no diet or exercise will ever change. This is an area one should consider for treatment of Coolsculpting. With that being said, each treatment will not reduce 100% of the fat, and thus some may require multiple treatment to achieve their desired “end point” of ideal results.</p><p>In this case a consultation is absolutely required so that we may see exactly the areas you wish to treat and explain what kind of results you can look to achieve. (Edward Stokes, MD, West Hollywood Physician)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting does work!</em></p><p>I will not offer anything to my patients that I have not first-tried on myself & second-been happy with my results. CoolSculpting does work! I LOVE my results on my abdomen and flanks. (Melanie L. Petro, MD, Birmingham Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting</strong></p><p>Yes! Coolsculpting does work, but not on all types of fat. The fat that is amenable to treatment with Coolsculpting is called subcutaneous fat. This is fat directly beneath the skin. Visceral fat, or the fat that is deeper, and surrounds the organs, is not able to be treated with Coolsculpting.</p><p>The ideal type of fat for treatment with Coolsculpting has to be pinchable, and essentially easy to grab and take hold of with the Coolsculpting applicator. Your final result with a Coolsculpting technique won’t appear for approximately three months after treatment.</p><p>That being said, there is some evidence to suggest that the benefits of Coolsculpting treatment can be accentuated if your second treatment to the area occurs about a month after the first.
