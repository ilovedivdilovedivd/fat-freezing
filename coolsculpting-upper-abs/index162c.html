<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Cryolipolysis upper abs is not a way to lose weight, so your weight should be close to ideal before the procedure.</p><p>If you still have extra pounds, wait. Cryolipolysis will be more useful towards the end of a long journey called “weight loss”. Coolsculpting will help to achieve the ideal outlines of the body and add the finishing touches to your work on yourself.</p><p>For the procedure to be effective, it is necessary to have a sufficient amount of soft fat. The fat fold is drawn into the applicator during cryolipolysis. There are nozzels of three different sizes.</p><h3>How many procedures will be needed?</h3><p>Some people are helped by one procedure: patients leave happy with a reduction in the fat layer by 20%.</p><p>Other people need to go through three procedures and more, repeatedly performing them every two months or less.</p><p>Tell the doctor about your expectations. The doctor will draw up a plan of procedures. And you will also learn how much money you will need to spend.</p><p>About 10 percent of patients experience pain after the procedure. You can feel just fine all the time, but pain can occur anywhere from a few days to several weeks. Know that you always need to be prepared for any side effects.</p><p>Those patients who experience severe pain, doctors recommend taking painkillers. Only one part of the body (for example, the upper or lower abdomen, one side, one side of the waist) may be subject to an hourly procedure.</p><p>You will simply sit or lie down throughout the procedure, so if you want to process several zones, the time will increase substantially. Bring a book or tablet with you, so as not to get bored.</p><h3>After the procedure</h3><p>Pay attention to your body. Some side effects are absolutely normal: pain, itching, swelling. But if you are concerned, tell your doctor about it. Still it is necessary to remember constantly that side effects vary depending on a zone of influence.</p><p>The most problematic zone is the abdomen. Patients most often complain of numbness, tingling and pain just after the procedure on the abdomen. The procedure in other areas, such as the hips, back and waist, usually does not cause almost no side effects.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_7947" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>To see the result, it will take some time. So it may be hard to notice that the procedure is working. Often take photos of the zones on which cryolipolysis was done, then compare them and notice that the changes still have a place to be.</p><h3>Have patience</h3><p>Results can become noticeable in one month, and after four. You can start to notice the results soon after three weeks, but really noticeable changes will appear in two months. Your body will still get rid of fat cells and will continue to do this for 4-6 months after the procedure.</p><p>So it’s important to stay patient and give your body time to get rid of fat cells.</p><h4>Long-term result depends only on you</h4><p>As with any cosmetic procedure, the duration of the results will depend on your behavior in the future. If you do not eat properly and do not exercise, cryolipolysis will not save you from weight gain (although it may help not to store fat in the places where the procedure was done).</p><p>If you want to look great in the long-term perspective, stick to proper nutrition and lead an active lifestyle.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_7948" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>Cosmetologists are strongly advised to abandon the use of any device for home cryolipolysis.</p><p>This is a unique procedure that requires special accuracy of its implementation. This can only be done by a specialist who has received appropriate preparation. In no case should you start applying ice compresses to the body, as this is fraught with frostbite. The matter is that during cryolipolysis the skin is protected from this negative effect.</p><p>Expensive equipment is used for cryolipolysis, which clearly does not compare with cheap home applicators. If you, nevertheless, have acquired such a device, it is worth initially consulting with the doctor. Perhaps with it help you can carry out a regular massage, which, in principle, will bring some benefit, but not obvious weight loss.</p><h3>EXPERT OPINION</h3><p><strong>Cosmetologist</strong></p><p></p>

</div>This procedure should be a breakthrough in cosmetology in the fight against excess weight and problems of the constitutional structure of man. On the other side of the scale is liposuction, and forecasts for this procedure is disappointing.
<p>The fact is that this is a much more painful way to solve the same problem, which has more contraindications. Liposuction is also less effective, as the patient quickly returns to its original state.</p><p>Cryolipolysis is actively developing, various manufacturers patent new techniques promising a better effect. At the moment, there are studies on the individual consequences of the procedure. If doctors do not reveal anything dangerous, then liposuction, for sure, will be a thing of the past.</p><p><strong>Plastic Surgeon</strong></p><p>I think coolsculpting on upper abs is an excellent procedure, with the help of which it is possible to correct the body shape well. It is impossible to say exactly how long one session lasts, since it depends on the amount of work, the type of the device used. If the latest technology is used, then processing can take only 35-45 minutes, but sometimes it takes about 2 hours. At one time you can get rid of 20-25% of fat deposits.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_7950" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-cb5346bf8529a797300e7202e2949973">

</div><p>But the result is not instantaneous, as it will take about 2-3 months to see the final effect. Often, not one cryolipolysis procedure is assigned to achieve the desired forms. Re-treatment is carried out not earlier than 30-45 days.</p><h3>REVIEWS</h3><p>Let’s see what the patients who undergo this procedure say about cryolipolysis:</p><p><em>Man, 34 years old:</em></p><p>“I have been doing sports for a long time, I attend the gym and even see the progress. All is well, except one fat on the stomach does not want to disappear anywhere. Our family have all the problems with being overweight, I got not a very good genetics.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_7951" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In general, I decided on the procedure. Honestly, it was not as pleasant as they promised. Ok, the first minutes were just cold. Well imagine, the feeling is as if a piece of ice was placed on the abdomen, which does not melt.</p><p>But the skin quickly became numb and a burning sensation began. Then about 15 minutes was painful. And about the 3rd week I began to lose in volume. A month passed and I lost 3 cm in the abdomen area. But the last half hour all just numb.</p><p>Now about the result – first there was a bruise on my stomach. It’s ugly and unpleasant to touch. The cosmetologist says that for a month a couple of centimeters will go away. Outcome: it works, not as cool as promised, but I now agree on everything.”</p><p><em>Woman, 45 years old:</em></p><p>“I have no problems with being overweight, but I suffer a typical accountant problem is a sedentary lifestyle has weakened the abdominal muscles, after which the lower part began to sag. A little fat accumulated in the abdomen area.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_7952" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Then I heard from colleagues about cryolipolysis. They saw enough photos before and after the procedure, read reviews, and decided. Three months later, my waistline decreased by 4 cm, the girl 29 years old (after childbirth) lost 6 cm, but our older colleague (53 years old) has lost almost nothing.</p><p>It’s a shame to admit, but it’s not surprising since she eat a very large number of sweets. I am very pleased with the result, coolsculpting has become the impetus for a healthy lifestyle. ”</p><p>This is all the information that must be known to those who decided to perform coolsculpting of upper abs. Painless and completely safe method, cryolipolysis allows you to quickly get rid of the problem of fat deposition quite easily and quickly. The patient will be able to see the results within a month or two, and excess fatty deposits will not return again if you adhere to a healthy diet.</p></div>
