<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h5>Appropriate Coolscupting Treatment Time</h5><p>The original technology CoolSculpting applicators took one hour per area treated. The new Advantage technology applicators take only 35 minutes to do an even better job. (Edward Stokes, MD, West Hollywood Physician)</p><p>the original applicators were 60 minutes per treatment area. The new cool advantage applicators are 35 minute per treatment area. (Brian Young, DO, Saint Clair Shores Physician)</p><p>We have found the advantage and mini applicators to be more effective as there is more contact with the cooling portions of the applicator. (Sheila S. Nazarian, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The difference between the two treatments is the amount of time it takes results should be the same. It is best to schedule a consult with a board certified plastic surgeon to see if you are a candidate. (Himansu Shah, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Efficacy of CoolSculpting after previous liposuction</h4><p>Cool Sculpting can be used as an ancillary treatment after previous surgery including liposuction surgery. Generally CoolSculpting can remove upto 25% of fat present under the skin. Previous liposuction will not have removed all the fat you had and if there has been some weight gain with increased volume and profile convexity the yes CoolSculpting is a perfectly reasonable method to address it.</p><p>It would be good to discuss this with your original surgeon if possible. (Tariq Ahmad, MBBChir, FRCS(Plast), Cambridge Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolAdvantage versus CoolSculpting</em></p><p>The CoolAdvantage applicators have a newer shape and design that allows for shortened duration of treatments.</p><p>These cycles last 35 minutes. These new applicators are promoted to not only shorten treatment times, but also to cover more area (treat more fat), and do it with less discomfort.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1951" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>When studied, most patients prefer the CoolAdvantage applicators over the first generation ones. Finally and most importantly, you probably get better treatment results when you compare 35 minute CoolAdvantage treatments to older 60 minute CoolScultping applicators and 60 minute cycles, due to more tissue being covered and treated. (Brian Opitz, MD, Greensboro Physician)</p><p>In the past, regular Coolsculpting applicators took 60 minutes. Now, with the CoolAdvantage applicators, each applicator only takes 35 minutes! (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>New Applicators are Quicker</h3><p>New applicators have been released in the last year. These applicators are more comfortable to the client and take nearly half the time to treat. (Kurtis Martin, MD, Cincinnati Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The new applicators are faster and more efficient and you would need treatment for 35 minutes instead of full 60 mins with old applicators. (Ramandeep Sidhu, MD, Issaquah Vascular Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1952" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Normally, a cycle would lasts any where from 35-45 minutes, depends on the applicator. (Konstantin Bukov, MD, San Francisco Physician)</p><p>The newest CoolSculpting technology is 35 min per cycle. It is called CoolAdvantage. You may want to call your provider to find out if this was what you were treated with. The new hand-pieces are cooler which allows them to treat in less time, while still being just as or a little bit more effective. (Janet Allenby, DO, Delray Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Real Advantages to Cool Advantage?</strong></p><p>We have been working with the Cool Advantage applicator since it was released. There is definitely much less vacuum so it is more comfortable for patients. Since the change in the technology is that the entire vacuum cup is a cooling plate, there is actually 11cm square more tissue treated than the previous applicator.</p><p>Based on the scientific studies, the results are the same if not better. (Grace Liu, MD, Newport Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Is it true that coolsculpting doesn’t work on people who had lipo in the past?</strong></p><p>Coolsculpting can still be effective as long as the area of treatment is able fit in the device. Coolsculpting helps to freeze the fat and it resorbs over time. Most people do require at least 2 treatments possibly more.</p><p>It is best to discuss this with your board certified plastic surgeon. (Himansu Shah, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The results using the CoolAdvantage applicators are very similar to those seen using the old applicators. The difference between the two applicators is that the entire CoolAdvantage applicator is a cooling panel, rather than just the central cooling panel used on the old applicator.</p><p>This allows the CoolAdvantage applicators to use less suction to achieve the same results, creating a more comfortable CoolSculpting experience in less time than the other applicators. (David P. Rapaport, MD, FACS, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>As long as pockets of fatty tissue can be identified and pulled into Coolsculpting machine applicator – it should work. I would advise you see Coolsculpting specialist for consultation. They will be able to give you some realistic expectations. (Armen Kirakosyan, MD, FACOG, FACS, East Aurora Urogynecologist)</p><p>The skin is cooled to the same temperature so the results should be the same. If you have any more questions about the new applicators you can visit the CoolSculpting website. If you are interested in the procedure, ensure that you visit a physician experienced in CoolSculpting.. (Martin Jugenburg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>New Coolsculpting Applicators</b></p><p>The new applicators provide efficacious results just like the old applicators if not more. The new applicators are more advanced. They reduce discomfort during treatment and treatment time is less because the new system is 1 degree Celsius cooler.</p><p>There have been clinical studies showing less discomfort and more efficacy. (Kathleen Morno, MD, Highland Park Physician)</p><h5>Advantage of Cool Advantage</h5><p>Since the Cool Advantage has come out, our patients have really enjoyed the fact the treatment time is almost half (only 35 minutes).</p><p>I have tried both types of applicators myself (the older versions and the new Cool Advantage) and I felt the discomfort with the Cool Advantage was less. The temperature your fat cells attain is -11 degrees Celsius vs the -10 degrees Celsius with the older version which is why we can do the treatment in a shorter period of time. The Cool Advantage can grab more tissue than the older version since it is a rounded applicator.</p><p>It also works better for those with denser fat that may not have been able to get into the older applicators as well, therefore it can be more efficacious. I like using it on all fat that we CoolSculpt, including the inner thighs, banana rolls (under the butt), abdomen, flanks and arms. (Tianna Tsitsis, MD, Mount Vernon Physician)</p><p><em>Coolsculpting Results with CoolAdvantage–Add Radiofrequency, Thermage, Vanquish, Venus Legacy, Exilis Ultra</em></p><p>The new application is the same as before just limits the amount of pain and the amount of time needed for the procedure. Results are essentially the same. For best results with Coolsculpting, I recommend a combination approach.</p><p>I recommend adding radiofrequency treatments like Vanquish, Venus Legacy, Exilis Ultra for skin tightening and with Z wave/Cellutone for skin smoothing. VASER with ThermiRF is the best alternative, especially for the abdomen and thighs, if you want a more contouring outcome. (Jason Emer, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Cooladvantage for thighs?</b></p><p>I think there is a benefit for any area it is applied to. The treatment times are less, and supposedly there is faster results. I would make sure it is combined with the Z Wave for even better results and adding the Vanquish, will make it the best yet. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The CoolAdvantage works extremely well on the inner thighs, on the right candidate. With the new CoolAdvantage applicators, the applicator only needs to be applied to each inner thigh for 35 minutes (as opposed to 60 minutes with the traditional applicators).</p><p>Patients also report less discomfort and less bruising. Our patients are quite pleased with the results of CoolSculpting on the inner thighs. (Kent V. Hasen, MD, Naples Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting- Is CoolAdvantage Better?</strong></p><p>We think of CoolAdvantage as being better, faster and stronger. Our patients truly love the results they get with the CoolAdvantage applicators. They actually cover more area than previous generations, take nearly half the time for treatment(time is money), and yield even better results.</p><p>And, let’s not forget how much more comfortable they are during treatment, and how much less post treatment discomfort patients experience. I would highly recommend these newest applicators to anyone who is considering this treatment.</p><p>If you treat your inner thighs with CoolAdvantage Fit, the treatment time will only be 35 minutes per leg. The original CoolFit takes 1 hour per leg, that is a significant savings of time. And, the CoolAdvantage are just so much more comfortable.</p><p>Why not enjoy your treatment? I think CoolAdvantage is clearly the winning choice all around. (Edward Stokes, MD, West Hollywood Physician)</p><p><em>Coolscupting, should I get the Cooladvantage </em></p><p>Cooladvantage applicators are better than a regular applicator for three reasons: A shorter treatment time. Almost half of the treatment time of a regular applicator. It is more comfortable and there is more tissue treated due to a bigger cooling area. (Alain Michon, MD, Ottawa Physician)</p><p>Cooladvantage is just an update on the applicator in terms of time required 35 minutes vs 1 hour. Clinically it performs the exact same was as it predecessor. (Drew Varano, MD, Washington DC Physician)</p><h5>CoolSculpting for the inner thighs</h5><p>CoolSculpting results using the CoolAdvantange or the earlier version of the CoolSculpting CoolFit applicator are likely comparable. For inner thigh, the determining factor regarding choice of applicator may be the length of the intended treatment area.</p><p>The CoolAdvantage treats a longer area compared with the earlier applicator version. For some, the CoolAdvantage is ideal, for others, it may extend to an area of the inner thigh that does not require treatment (no fat bulge).</p><p>Your provider should be able to make a recommendation based on your needs.
