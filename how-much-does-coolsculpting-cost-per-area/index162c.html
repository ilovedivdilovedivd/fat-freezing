<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Pricing for coolsculpting depends on the area. Small applicator is $750 per area per session.</p><p>So lower abdomen could be 2 small areas or 1 large area. A large applicator is $1500 per area.</p><p>Double chin treatment is $1000 per treatment. Outer thigh is $1500 per treatment per area.</p><p>Most clients require anywhere from 1 to 3 sessions depending on how much fat they have.</p><p>I recommend clients to come in for a complimentary consultation to determine how many areas and treatments will be required. (Hardik Soni, MD (not currently practicing), Summit Emergency Medicine Physician)</p><p>Generally, the cost of cool sculpting depends on the area(s) and the number of cycles you purchase. A cycle is defined as one freeze/thaw session.</p><p>The number of cycles needed depends on the number of areas to be treated, the size of the areas and the number of treatments to each area–we recommend a minimum of two cycles for each area.</p><p>The cost for a single cycle is usually $750, but is less if more cycles are purchased as a package. (Jeffrey D. Wagner, MD, Indianapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>How much does Coolsculpting Cost?</i></p><p>The great news is that the price is actually come down a bit. We see the best results when you “treat to complete”. This means you get price breaks for adding additional areas or treating the same area twice.</p><p>Pricing is starting as low as $500 now. This makes it truly affordable and with no down time your back on your way quickly. (Frederick Lester, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting costs between $700-1000 per applicator. Most people require around 2-4 small applicators per treatment and one treatment may be enough depending on the size of the area. (William Kwan, MD, FAAD, San Francisco Dermatologist)</p><p><em>Pricing of CoolSculpting</em></p><p>I would encourage you not to choose your CoolSculpting procedure based on price alone. There are several factors that are important to achieving maximum benefit from CoolSculpting. You want to look for someone in your area who has a great deal of experience.</p><p>My personal bias is that you should also look for a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon. Not everyone is a good candidate for CoolSculpting and if you are better served by Liposuction, a BCPS will let you know and can perform Lipo as well.</p><p>Pricing varies by the area of the country you are in and are generally about the same within the city. Most practices seem to offer discounts for when you treat more areas. (Suresh Koneru, MD, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Cost</i></p><p>The cost depends on what area you are interested in treating and how many treatment sessions are needed. Certain areas are considered large areas and other considered small. Typically 2 treatments are needed. Cost can also vary practice to practice! (Sugene Kim, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The price for a CoolSculpting treatment depends on each individual and the number of areas they would like treated. We would need to evaluate the patient during a consultation. The range of pricing per area is anywhere from $750 – $1500. (Robert A. Graham, MD, Fresno Physician)</p><p>The cost of Coolsculpting will depend on your areas of concern and number of applications that are needed to achieve your desired goals. They can range from $600 to well over $6000 depending on the treatment plan.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_40" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I would recommend going to a board certified plastic surgeon that offers several body contouring options for you to choose from so you understand the cost/benefits of each option. (Young R. Cho, MD, PhD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of Coolscultping is different for everyone. There are different applicators used for particular areas of the body and each one is priced differently. Prices start at $750.00 for a small applicator to $1500.00 for the large applicator.</p><p>Please visit a Certified CoolSculpting Professional to determine if CoolSculpting is right for you and also to receive your personal quote. (Shehla Ebrahim, MD, Vancouver Physician)</p><p>CoolSculpting pricing in my plastic surgery practice are $1250 per area (two cycles-small applicator / hips, back, love handles), $1250 for lower abdomen (one cycle large applicator), $750 for upper abdomen (one cycle)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_41" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Packages are available with reduced pricing for two, three or more areas. (Lawrence W. Shaw, MD, Arizona Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting costs range from $600-$1200 per treatment area. You may need multiple treatment areas, however, most practices offer packages where significant discounts can be given, as well as payment plans with Care credit, etc.</p><p>Considering the results that can be achieved with this non-invasive treatment, it is fair to say it is priceless! (Shamim Shakibai, MD, Los Angeles Physician)</p><p>The CoolSculpting treatment costs 1,500 dollars for the central abdomen large applicator. For the smaller applicator on the flanks or point areas on the abdomen the value is 750 dollars per treatment area.</p><p>Recommendations are for seeing a board certified plastic surgeon who can treat you across the full spectrum of options.</p><p>Remember, if all you have is a hammer, then everything is just a nail….. (R. Brannon Claytor, MD, FACS, Bryn Mawr Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Coolsculpting costs- Things to consider for your treatment</i></p><p>Coolsculpting is a state of the art treatment for fat reduction. It is also the most versatile in-office procedure to treat multiple areas like the stomach, love-handles, neck, arms and thighs. It is an exceptional treatment that gives our patients great results.</p><p>In my practice I evaluate all cool sculpt patients to make sure they are good candidates and will receive treatment in the right spots. In general the cost is about $750 per area and usually 4 or more areas will be treated to garner noticeable improvements. (Steven M. Camp, MD, Fort Worth Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>CoolSculpting costs are affordable.</h5><p>A procedure cost may range between $650 to $1300 depending on applicator size and area of placement. A standard applicator can be used on love handles, inner thighs, outer thighs, abdomen in women. The largest applicator available is used mostly to treat the abdomen.</p><p>If the patient treats multiple areas, there is a significant discount to the cost. (Steven Gabel, MD, FACS, Portland Hair Restoration Surgeon)</p><p>In our practice the cost is $750 per cycle. The cost per cycle decreases the more cycles you purchase. The number of cycles needed depends on the area, the size of the area and the number of treatments to the area.</p><p>We recommend a minimum of two. (Janet Turkle, MD, Indianapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>It depends on the area you live as well as the number of areas treated. </strong></p><p>CoolSculpting or Cryolypolysis is a non-invasive method of freezing localized fatty deposits resulting in reduction of the fatty collections. The cost depends on the size of the area treated (different attachments run different amounts) also the number of areas treated.</p><p>In Los Angeles one area typically runs ~$700-1000. If you require multiple areas most practices offer a package discount for 3 or 5 areas. (Joseph B. Eby, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Zeltiq prices can vary</h4><p>Nationally Zeltiq averages $600-$800 per treatment, usually the cost drops if you buy more than one treatment or are re-treating an area. </p><p>What is great about Zeltiq is sometimes you only have to treat an area once to get results so the treatment can be less expensive than Botox and fillers. (Lorrie Klein, MD, Laguna Niguel Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>How Much Does CoolSculpting by Zeltiq Cost?</i></p><p>Most practices have the same pricing guideline. The more areas you buy the price per area goes down. Single areas are typically around $700 and multiple areas can be as low as $425. Our practice offers a Membership program.</p><p>After buying a certain amount of areas you are locked in for life at the lowest rate. (Brian C. Reuben, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting typically starts at $750 but varies from patient to patient depending on what area you treat and how many applicators (suction cups) you need to give you your desired result. One person may just need one suction cup on each love handle and others might need 2 on each side.</p><p>We are also asymmetrical from one love handle to the other. The best way to find out how much your CoolSculpting will cost is to a get a CoolSculpting evaluation. Consults are often times free of charge and would give you all the information you needed on your specific body area or areas to make a decision if you wanted to proceed with the treatment.
