<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>CoolSculpting is a customized treatment that is tailored to your specific needs and goals.</p><p>The length of your treatment will depend on the number of cycles and areas you are having treated.</p><p>In our office we offer CoolAdvantage, the latest is CoolSculpting technology and treatment times range from 35-45 minutes per applicator.</p><p>We also have multiple CoolSculpting machines, so we are able to treat multiple areas at once.</p><p>It is recommended that you have an in person consultation to determine your best treatment plan. (Timothy Zelko, DO, Westmont Physician)</p><p>Coolsculpting treatment time depends on how cycles are being used during one session. Each cycle varies in time from 35 to to 115 mins depending on the applicator. We use all the newest generation of applicators and they are faster, more comfortable and have less downtime.</p><p>Clients can typically expect to do 2 treatments 4-8 weeks apart. (Marcia Fleming, MD, Vancouver Physician)</p><p>Coolsculpting is an FDA-approved permanent fat loss procedure. It decreases the total number of fat cells in the area that is treated. The number of procedures needed depends on the amount of fat in the area and the desired result.</p><p>Typically, patients require 1 to 2 treatments for moderate areas of fat, and 2 to 3 treatments in areas that have more severe fat deposits. There is some evidence to suggest repeating the second treatment within a month of the first treatment may enhance the result. (Mariam Cappiello, MD, Chestnut Hill Anesthesiologist)</p><p>The treatment time will vary depending on the area being treated and the applicators being used. With the new Cooladvantage applicator the time is 35 minutes per applicator. For the abdomen you may need up to 4 applicators requiring 2hours and 20mins plus pre and post treatment preparation.</p><p>The number of treatments will depend on the amount of treatable fat and what you are personally trying to achieve, in most instants 2-3 treatment sessions are required. The Fiori Institute of Skin and Body. (Davin Lim, MBBS, FACD, Brisbane Dermatologist)</p><p><em>Duration of Coolsculpting procedure and how do you decide the total number of treatments.</em></p><p>The duration of each coolsculpt procedure depends upon the following factors.</p><p>1. The number of machines used for the treatment. In our facility we have two machines and we offer “Dualsculpting” that means we can treat two areas at the same time.</p><p>2. The duration is also decided by the type of applicators used. Our new “Cooladvantage applicators” and “Dualsculpting” can take 35 mins for two treatments. The total number of treatments needed are decided by the following factors.</p><p>1. The total number of treatments are based on the area of concern, size and the density of the fat and the desired body shape. Consultation and education is the key to understand the treatment plan. (Shanthala Shivananjappa, MD, Boston Physician)</p><h4>Treatment Times</h4><p>Coolsculpting takes about an hour. You might want to compare Coolsculpting technology to Sculpsure technology as Sculpsure is faster to administer (only 25 minutes per treatment) and is often reported be be more comfortable.</p><p>Both Sculpsure and Coolsculpting remove around 22% of fat in a are per treatment. (Jeffrey T. Camp, MD, Truckee Physician)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting gets rid of unwanted body fat or a double chin </strong></p><p>The treatment time for CoolSculpting is dependent upon the size and location of the area being treated. Each cycle is usually completed in 45 min to one hour, followed by massage to ensure a fast recovery and optimal results.</p><p>The average patient will require two CoolSculpting treatments spaced at one month apart to reach their goals. The number of fat cells determines the number of treatments needed, so some patients will need only one session, while others may require more.</p><p>The fat cells targeted by the CoolSculpting procedure are gone for good. (Jia Zheng, MD, Vancouver Physician)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting is permanent.</strong></p><p>Coolsculpting is permanent meaning that if you maintain your body weight, the fat shouldn’t come back. The number of treatments is dependent on how much you want to lose. Expect 20% reduction per applicator. (William Kwan, MD, FAAD, San Francisco Dermatologist)</p><h3>CoolSculpting is permanent fat reduction</h3><p>CoolSculpting is a permanent fat reduction procedure that results in approximately 25% reduction per treatment. We advise that all patients have at least two treatments to see benefits. The abdomen is very responsive to CoolSculpting as long as you have subcutaneous fat, not visceral fat.</p><p>On average in our practice, this cost would be about $2500-$3500 depending on how many treatment cycles were recommended.</p><p>Each patient retains fat differently, and that is why each cost estimate may be different. In our office, we offer complimentary consultations and written quotes for every patient. (Mark E. Mason, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Time to CoolSculpt</h5><p>What area do you want to treat?If you are treating areas on both sides of the body, like the thighs or love handles, treatment will take twice as long if you don’t have two machines.</p><p>Fortunately, OmniAestheticMD offers DualSculpting–two CoolSculpting machines that can operate simultaneously, thereby cutting your treatment time in half. Come in for a complimentary consultation. (Joseph A. Eviatar, MD, FACS, New York Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Fat reduction from Coolsculpting can be permanent and the number of treatments needed to treat a stomach area can vary.</h4><p>Coolsculpting by Zeltiq is an excellent treatment that permanently reduces fat by a process that freezes then destroys the fat cells. The fat cells that are destroyed do not come back. The issue is that we have thousands of fat cells that are fluid filled or flat.</p><p>At the time of your Coolsculpting treatment some of the fat cells that are in contact with the applicator are destroyed.</p><p>The number of times the area on your stomach need to be treated to achieve your goals, depends on how much excess fat you have.</p><p>If you have upper and lower stomach excess fat each area may need to be treated 2-4 times. We now have many different size applicators to treat the stomach area so when you have your consultation it’s important to ask how many treatments you will need to achieve your goal.</p><p>Remember that the best candidate for fat reduction with Coolsculpting, laser liposuction (smart lipo) and traditional liposuction are those that have excess fat resistant to a healthy diet and exercise. (Laurie A. Casas, MD, FACS, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>How many treatments and how long for CoolSculpting?</strong></p><p>The abdomen can vary greatly in the number of treatments or cycles it takes to achieve each person’s goals. The abdomen usually takes 35 minutes for each cycle, however with marking and setup I usually plan on an hour.</p><p>It is twice as fast if the office has what is known as DualSculpting like I have in our office. It essentially is 2 machines that can treat 2 cycles at the same time so the treatment time is half as long.</p><p>This is only true however if you need more than 1 treatment which most abdomens do. It can be anywhere from 2 to 6 treatments. Some patients will come back in 1 to 3 months for even more fat reduction too.</p><p>The only way to know for sure is to go in for a consultation! You have nothing to lose, but stubborn fat, so go in and discover the possibilities. (W. John Bull, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>There are a couple of variables</b></p><p>The length of the procedure can vary depending on how many machines the practice has (We have 2 so we do Dual Coolsculpting), which applicators are used and how many cycles you will need.</p><p>It can be from 1 to 8 cycles, depending on how much excess fat you want to get rid of and you can expect a 15%-25% reduction of fat in that area after a full 3 months of your treatment!</p><p>Be sure you inquire at a “Coolsculpting Certified Practice”All the best to you and you getting fabulous results! (Robert F. Gray, MD, FACS, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting treatments can be as fast as 35 minutes and can extend to one hour depending on the area that we are treating. Typical appointments can be from 1 hour to 4 hours for patients getting multiple areas treated.</p><p>The most common areas that we treat are abdomen and flanks and upper arms which typically will need two treatments per zone depending on the amount of fat that is present in those areas. (Delio Ortegon, MD, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>How many treatments?</strong></p><p>One of the great things about CoolSculpting is that it is so personalized. Most offices offer a free consultation and you will work with someone to determine exactly what areas you would like. Even on the abdomen, there are many choices and you will devise a program that works for you and meets your needs. (Lillian Schapiro, MD, Atlanta OB-GYN)</p></div>
