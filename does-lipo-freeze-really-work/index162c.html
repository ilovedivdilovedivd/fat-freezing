<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>CoolSculpting does really work! It provides approximately a 25% permanent fat reduction in the area of treatment.</p><p>It is best suited for individuals that live a healthy lifestyle and just have “pockets” of fat that want to be removed.</p><p>It can also be used to enhance curves. It takes 2-4 months to see full results. (Janet Allenby, DO, Delray Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting really works for the right candidate. It uses a technology called cryolipolisis to freeze and destroy fat cells, which are then naturally eliminated by the body.</p><p>Patients can expect a 20-30% reduction in fat after one treatment; multiple treatments may be needed to achieve a patient’s goals.</p><p>It is important to have CoolSculpting done only if you are a good candidate for the procedure and if you are able to maintain a steady weight, as gaining weight can interfere with results.</p><p>I recommend visiting a board-certified plastic surgeon with experience performing lipo freeze treatments for an in-person consultation to determine if you would benefit from the procedure. (John Diaz, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>CoolSculpting, Vanquish results</h3><p>Zeltiq or Coolsculpting works for fat reduction because it freezes the fat using controlled cooling. You will see results after about 3 months.</p><p>Vanquish and Cellutone can be added to get even more improvement. We call this “Fire and Ice” treatment and is the best treatment for localized fat reduction.</p><p>There are many studies that show coolsculpting to work roughly 15-20% improvement in a given area in one treatment. (Jason Emer, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting works by causing controlled apotosis (death) of the fat cell while also not getting so cold as to cause damage to the overlying skin. With each treatment about 20% of fat is reduced. Please find a treating physician for more information specific to your area of interest. (Michelle Ellern, DO, Livingston Physician)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_168" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><i>Coolsculpting really works for fat reduction</i></p><p>Coolsculpting is a very effective fat reduction treatment. Combined with a healthy diet and regular exercise results become visible 4-6 weeks following treatment with improvement continuing for up to 4 months. If you are interested to see if Coolsculpting is right ask for a personal consultation with a Certified CoolSculpting Professional. (Shehla Ebrahim, MD, Vancouver Physician)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpt has good results</strong></p><p>We have been using this technology for five years and our patients have been very pleased with the results. In the area where the applicator is applied, the fat can be reduced anywhere from 14-42%.</p><p>A common result is a 20% reduction in the area treated. Most patients do several sessions but only one session is necessary to obtain a result. (Pramit Malhotra, MD, Ann Arbor Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Absolutely ! </em></p><p>Our patients have been extremely pleased with their results. We are able to treat the abdomen, flanks, inner and outer thighs and now the chin area!</p><p>We are excited about the new handpiece that is coming out because it will allow us to treat the same areas in half the time! If you are considering CoolSculpting, I’d make sure that the staff is trained by CSU it makes a difference! (Sharon J. Littzi, MD, New Canaan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Coolscultpting realy works…. well yes, but Know what to expect.</b></p><p>We have been very satisfied with the consistent nonsurgical fat reduction results seen with Coolscultping in our Albany NY and Saratoga Springs office on targeted areas like the lower abdomen, flanks, thighs, and bra roll</p><p>The reason I selected it was in fact because of the predictability as compared with other noninvasive fat reduction options – ultrasound and radiofrequency based energy systems.</p><p>But, predictability means about a 20-25% reduction in the zone of the applicator. This means, that results are going to be more visible, the closer you are to your ideal form. Thus its better suited for targeted problem areas rather than as a body sliming procedure.</p><p>To determine if this procedure to remove fat without surgery is the correct one for you, first take a look in the mirror, and see if you can isolate your concerns to one or two areas, then make a consultation with a facility that provides an accurate representation of the limits and potential for this procedure. (Arthur N. Falk, MD, Albany Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Does CoolSculpting Really Work to Remove Fat?</em></p><p>Absolutely, CoolSculpting does a brilliant job at permanently removing fat cells from the body. Each area that is treated will see a 20-25% reduction in the fat cells of that area. The treated cells will die over a three day period post treatment.</p><p>They are then removed from the body by the lymphatic drainage system over a period of a few months The average adult has a set number of fat cells. Most adults have areas where fat will deposit naturally.</p><p>When adults gain weight, with the exception of actual obesity, the fat cells are simply getting bigger. If we lose weight, they get smaller. When these cells are destroyed and are removed from targeted treatment areas, this brings about a dramatic change in the patients countenance.</p><p>If the patient then gains weight, it will be more evenly distributed throughout the body, and will not be automatically seen in the areas that have been treated. CoolSculpting by Zeltiq really does work, and it is permanent.</p><p>And, what is really amazing is that CoolSculpting can treat so many areas of the body. Coolsculpting can treat upper and lower abdomen, love handles, bra bulges, inner and outer thighs, arms, banana rolls, knees and even under the chin.</p><p>The newest generation of applicators are incredibly comfortable, deliver more powerful results and take as little as 35 minutes for treatment. Also, keep in mind that CoolSculpting is the only non-invasive treatment for the removal of fat cells that has been approved by the FDA.</p><p>The ONLY one. (Edward Stokes, MD, West Hollywood Physician)</p><p><b>CoolSculpting works to reduce fat</b></p><p>Yes, CoolSculpting effectively targets and kills fat cells, leading to around a 20-30% reduction in fat after one treatment in the right candidate.</p><p>It is important that you are a good candidate for the procedure and that you maintain your weight, as remaining fat cells can enlarge and you can gain any inches lost back.</p><p>I recommend visiting a board-certified dermatologist for an in-person consultation to determine if CoolSculpting is right for you. (Mitchel P. Goldman, MD, San Diego Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Does lipo freeze really work?</strong></p><p>Yes! Lipo freeze really works! Our patients have had some incredible before/after results. It has the most peer reviewed journal articles in academic publications proving its efficacy. Now with the new applicators, treatments are faster and more effective, freezing even more fat than before.</p><p>Areas of the body treated include:upper/lower abdomen, flanks, love handles, hips, bra rolls, inner thighs, saddle bags, banana rolls (under the buttocks) and axillary bra fat, knees, and upper arms. It is non-invasive, non-surgical, and minimal pain. (Shamim Shakibai, MD, Los Angeles Physician)</p><p><i>Lipo freeze works in the right candidate</i></p><p>CoolSculpting uses a proprietary technology called cryolipolisis to freeze and destroy fat cells, which are then naturally eliminated by the body. Generally, there will be around a 20-30% reduction following one treatment. It is important that CoolSculpting is used on the right candidate and done by a skilled, board-certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon in order to ensure the best results, but yes, as long as the conditions are right CoolSculpting does work. (Sabrina Fabi, MD, San Diego Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>CoolSculpting works for appropriate candidates</h5><p>The short answer is yes, CoolSculpting does work for fat reduction. However, you must be an appropriate candidate for the procedure, and you must be able to maintain your weight. If you meet the criteria for CoolSculpting, generally you can expect around 25-30% reduction in the area treated after one session.</p><p>Depending on your goals, more sessions may be needed to achieve optimal results. (Margaret Weiss, MD, Baltimore Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>CoolSculpting Side Effects and Favorable Alternatives</h4><p>Coolsculpting is a 60-90 minute procedure that can be painful and may also have prolonged numbness. A fantastic alternative is Sculpsure, the only FDA-approved laser to melt 25% of your unwanted stubborn fat. These favorable results are realized 6-12 weeks after your single in-office 25 minute procedure.</p><p>Sculpsure is painless, in fact it provides pleasant warmth for the patient and the patient has no recovery and no downtime. I suggest you consult a board certified facial plastic surgeon to receive the highest quality knowledge, treatment, care and skill available. (Ross A. Clevens, MD, Melbourne Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
