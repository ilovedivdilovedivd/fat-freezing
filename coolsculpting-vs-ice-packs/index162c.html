<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><strong>Coolsculpting vs. Ice Pack</strong></p><p>Coolsculpting is a process of safe, gradual cooling that will target the fat cells and leave the skin, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels unharmed. An ice pack may not deliver enough cold to kill fat cells, and would probably damage the skin with prolonged exposure. One physician who we recently treated for coolsculpting told us how she had fallen asleep with an ice pack and ice pack had left an indentation so deep that it required medical care. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>CoolSculpting effective, Ice packs not effective</h5><p>The process is much more complicated than simply lowering the temperature of the surrounding tissue.</p><p>The suction device and the plates apply the change in temperature to the deep tissues where the fat is. This leaves the skin unharmed by the process. The temperature change specifically to the deeper layer of fat induces a change in the cells which promote accelerated cell death.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_578" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>THe process takes over 3 months to come full circle which is why the best results are noted at 3 months.</p><p>Using ice topically on the skin would produce frostbite of the skin long before it had any changes of the deep underlying fat cells.</p><p>If considering cryolipolysis then consider a board certified plastic surgeon who is a member of ASAPS. (R. Brannon Claytor, MD, FACS, Bryn Mawr Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Coolsculpting vs ice packs</h5><p>The cooling panels from coolsculpting provides a consistent temperature of 2-4 degree Celsius for one hour. Yes there is a relation of fat and cold. However, the fat needs to get to that specific temperature for the fat cells to die.</p><p>I don’t recommended putting ice packs on yourself because you can injury yourself. If you’re still not satisfied, try booking another consultation somewhere else. You could have a totally different experience. (Robert G. Aycock, MD, FACS, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting, why not just use ice packs?</strong></p><p>Although the CoolSculpting procedure is commonly referred to “fat freezing”, temperatures of 32 degrees F are not employed with the device. Fat will “freeze” at temperatures higher than 32 degrees and this avoids damaging other structures such as skin, nerves, and blood vessels.</p><p>Ice packs applied to the skin produce the most cold at the skin level and the temperatures in the deeper tissues may still be too high to adequately damage the fat cells. CoolSculpting technology evenly lowers the temperature of the entire area of tissue being treated. (John Zavell, MD, FACS, Toledo Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting is based on a real medical condition which uses cold deep down to selectively destroy fat cells and to leave the skin from being effected. If we were to use ice packs, we can have all kinds of superficial problems for the skin and probably never reach the deep layers where the fat cells reside. (Michael Gold, MD, Nashville Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Ice packs instead of CoolSculpting</i></p><p>The concept is the same but the degree of freezing with ice packs alone is not as significant as the skin and fat being suctioned into the device thereby achieving a 3 degree temperature around 75% of the tissue.</p><p>Ice would only provide ~32 degrees around 50% of the tissue with the back of the tissue being warmed by the intra abdominal tissue. Not going to work. (Robert Graper, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Coolsculpting versus ice packs</i></p><p>Coolsculpting has studied the optimal cooling parameters to understand how much fat reduction can be achieved with an hour treatment. I would not recommend using ice as you might get frost bitten in the area that you attempt this if left for too long.</p><p>Coolsculpting induces apoptosis (controlled cell death). Ice related injuries often go through the necrotic pathway as it is a more intense injury. I would revisit with a Coolsculpting provider to discuss your options. (Young R. Cho, MD, PhD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Never that easy</h5><p>While your theory makes sense to a point, you have left out an important concern. If ice packs alone are used, the skin could be injured by frostbite as well. You’ve probably seen pictures of frostbite online and the tissue loss is dramatic.</p><p>In other words, the fat would be reduced, but the overlying skin could also die, resulting in potential scarring at best or the need for reconstructive surgery- skin grafts, flaps, or even amputations, at worst.</p><p>Coolsculpting solves this problem by monitoring the temperature carefully during the treatment cycle, and maintaining the temp at the point where the fat cell are affected but the skin is not damaged. (David Shuter, MD, Jupiter Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Why not just apply ice packs if freezing fat works?</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_582" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>The reason is that applying freezing ice to your skin can result in permanent injury to the skin from the direct effects of the cold. Cool sculpting works differently as the skin is first protected with a gel barrier, and the cold is carefully delivered with the delivery device to target the fat cells and not damage the overlying skin.</p><p>See a board certified plastic surgeon for a consultation and treatment plan. (Richard Chaffoo, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Freezing and Coolsculpting are not the same</i></p><p>At first this thought does make sense, but repeatedly placing ice packs over an area of fat is not the same as Coolsculpting. One would most definitely be able to induce apoptosis of fat cells with packs of ice, but you would likely also give yourself frostbite.</p><p>And the chances of unwanted side effects such as an open wound or permanent scarring would be significant. Coolsculpting provides a balance between delivering enough cold damage to the fat to cause cell death, and maintaining a safe environment for the overlying skin. (Joshua L. Fox, MD, Long Island Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Common Misconception</i></p><p>CoolSculpting devices have monitored cooling mechanisms with precision cooling that enables safety by affecting only the subcutaneous fat cells and not negatively effecting skin tissue, nerves or muscle.</p><p>Cryolipoysis is safe with minimal side effects when performed by a certified trained provider. If using ice packs repeatedly on the body, you will have no way control of the tissue temperature. This may cause damage to skin tissue and even frost bite.</p><p>Play it safe and see a certified CoolSculpting provider for your personal assessment and achieve your goals with CoolSculpting. (Missy Clifton, MD, Bentonville Dermatologist)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_584" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><strong>Using Cool Sculpting vs Ice Packs</strong></p><p>You would damage your skin with repeated use of ice packs. With the Cool Sculpting technology you are not in danger of injuring the skin. (Robert Whitfield, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting vs. Ice Packs</em></p><p>CoolSculpting is designed to freeze only the fat without damaging the skin. If you were to only apply ice packs to the skin you could cause damage to areas other than just the fat.</p><p>Without the cold being focused and regulated, like with the CoolSculpting device, you put yourself at risk of necrosis. (Jeffrey W. Hall, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Coolsculpting an Methodology</h5><p>Coolsculpting was developed by a Harvard based dermatologist under the principle of popsicle panniculitis. He observed that when ice is applied to areas inside the mouth, the fat area of the buccal mucosa was temporarily minimized.</p><p>These principles were expanded to create the coolsculpting machine which freezes the fat in a controlled way and at the same time protecting your skin. Ice backs would only serve to freeze your skin and can actually burn your skin.</p><p>Please consult a board certified dermatologist who is experienced with coolsculpting for this innovative and highly effective treatment. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p><i>Coolsculpting Kills Fat, Ice could kill your skin</i></p><p>The short answer is that there is no way to maintain the appropriate treatment temperatures. The Coolsculpting units are very sophisticated and they constantly monitor the treatment temperature. If it detects the skin is too cold the unit will shut down and stop treatment as a safety precaution.</p><p>It also makes sure the tissue is sufficiently cooled so the treatment is effective. It’s this type of precision that allows for both safe and effective treatment. There is no safe or effective do it yourself option.</p><p>You’ll likely have nothing to show for your efforts but potential frost bite. (Sarah A. Mess, MD, Columbia Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>CoolSculpting Temperature</h4><p>CoolSculpting utilizes a very specific temperature and process to ensure only the intended fat cells are targeted with the treatment. If skin and tissue were repeatedly exposed to other temperatures, necrosis and other untoward effects could occur (ex.frostbite). The CoolSculpting technology is able to target only the fat cells without harming other cells and tissues. (Kent V. Hasen, MD, Naples Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Using Ice Packs instead of Coolsculpting?</strong></p><p>The CoolSculpting Machine has been FDA cleared because of it’s technology. It has a precise temperature control and feedback mechanism so that it freezes the fat and not the overlying skin. This technology is what makes this procedure precise and successful.</p><p>You cannot replicate this with putting ice packs on your body. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Can the effects of CoolSculpting be replicated by the application of ice packs</h4><p>CoolSculpting is performed using a device that rather than delivering cold actually extracts energy (thereby cooling) the tissue. The device carefully monitors this process with continual feedback so that the temperatures achieved are such that the fat will freeze but not so cold that other tissue such as skin, muscles, nerves or blood vessels will.</p><p>One could never monitor such a process with the use of an ice pack. It is highly unlikely one could deliver cold enough temperatues to the fat with an ice pack alone and even if one were able to do so, you will most likely freeze the overlying skin.</p><p>As a result of the freezing of the skin, a scar will be induced. (Ted Brezel, MD, Long Island Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Freezing Fat with CoolSculpting</h4><p>CoolSculpting by Zeltiq selectively freezes fat cells while preserving surrounding tissues. (Michael Law, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The beauty of Coolsculpting is that the device evenly cools tissue, with both the optimal time and temperature of the device set.</p><p>Frozen peas or a pack of ice may actually lead to actual results, but I would be surprised if those results were aesthetically pleasing and safe!
