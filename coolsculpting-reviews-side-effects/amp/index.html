<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>– I had my cool sculpting treatment done Tuesday, I had a total of 8 cycles over 1 week. I’m beginning to feel nervous of the up coming pain I’ve read all about. I really hope this works I’m beginning to regret it as I feel bigger. I know it’s swelling.</p><p>– It’s now 18th April and two weeks after having Coolsculting done to two areas either side of my stomach below my waist I can now report that I did have a few nerve pains for a couple of days, but nowhere near as bad as reported by some people. Also, after two weeks the soreness sensitivity lessened a lot, but then a week later it felt worse again! It still sensitive and a bit numb, and painful if I rub my fingers over my stomach unless very lightly. Also I can feel lumps under my skin. Hoping things will resolve themselves after the full three months is up but at the moment although the swelling has lessened, my stomach looks the same as before treatment.</p><p>– I am now four weeks post procedure and the pain is pretty much gone in the abdomen, though it still feels strange there….I have noticed feelings in the love handle areas that were not there before (sensitivity, numbness and tingling, but no pain). The swelling has gone down, but the jury is still out in regards to the procedure being worth it (from what they say, it is more noticeable as you get closer to the eight week mark) . Have you noticed the swelling has gone down for you yet?</p><p>– I am three weeks post procedure. The first week was the worst. I no long feel the non stop stabbing pain, but the treated area is still a little painful to the touch. also feels strange when i get touched</p><p>– I had lower abdomen, love handles, upper arms, and bra bulge back area done November 3, 2016. I haven’t seen any results yet and I’m worried I wasted about $4200. I have considered gong back for a second treatment but was also worried that you have a time frame for a second treatment. Did you have better results after the second treatment? Also, how was the bruising the second treatment? My first treatment I looked like someone beat me up.</p><p>– I developed what is called Paradoxical Hyperplasia after 2 months!! I had to end up having a tummy tuck from the embarrassing big stomach it created!!</p><p>– I had my procedure done 8 days ago (2 large panels on abdomen and 1 smaller one on each love handle). The pain became almost unbearable yesterday and last night (in abdomen only…) I put an ice pack on my abdomen last night and it provided much needed relief. Have you tried this yet? It is still hurting me quite a bit and all I can say is this had better be worth it.</p><p>– I ended up taking the nerve block (neurotin). I had two pills yesterday. While the pain isn’t completely gone, it’s more tolerable. I was able to sleep through the night without waking up in pain. I’ll take another one around lunch, hopefully that will further reduce the pain. I would recommend telling your doctor about the pain. They will also prescribe neurotin for the pain.</p><p>– I called my doctor and they would not prescribe Neurontin. They first wanted me to try the Lidoderm pain patches… that was really annoying. So, I went to the pharmacy, tried the patches, they didn’t work, so, the doc finally called me in a prescription for the Neurontin, which I picked up at the pharmacy about 30 minutes ago (I immediately took one). So far it seems to be helping a little (takes a while to kick in I guess). I tried taking one of the patches off and it was SO painful! Did they make you do the patches first? The doc said I was one of the very few that had this problem! I feel like a guinea pig… but I got my Neurontin for the weekend so I am somewhat content now.</p><p>– My doc did not even prescribe me the patches. I think zeltiq recommends neurontin for the pain, which is why my doc eventually gave me that.</p><p>– I have taken three Neurontin and it seems to be helping. I was able to sleep very well last night. This morning I am starting to get that “knife in the gut” feeling again, so it’s definitely time for a pill. One thing I noticed is that the pain is worse being in a sitting position as opposed to a standing or lying position. Do you notice that, too? Also, I wanted to ask you – did they recommend you get the procedure done twice in the areas you have had done?</p><p>– it’s def worse while sitting. yesterday i had a flight 3 hour flight and half way through i started hurting a lot. I took a pill at night and slept like a baby.</p><p>– The throbbing pain is gone for me and I haven’t had the neurontin since saturday night. The area is still very sensitive and I can’t be touched there at all as it feels strangely painful.. almost icky. it’s unlike any other feeling I’ve ever had so I find that weird. But the pain is very tolerable now. I’ll give you an update as I anything changes.. btw I so want to get my upper abs and love handles treated (i am getting married in the summer), but i don’t think i can handle this again. i almost wish I’d gone the big bang approach like you and done everything at once.</p><p>– It has been 16 days since I had mine done and things are much better here also (except I am still a little sensitive and swollen). Haven’t had to use the Neurontin or patches in almost a week (I had been using them both). Still wearing loose clothing, though. The love handles I had done were nothing compared to the lower abdomen. The upper abdomen was bad, but not nearly as bad as the lower (from what I have hear, the lower is always the worst). They recommended that I repeat the same procedure after 8 weeks, but, I am going to see what the results are first before going through this again. If you decide to go back and have more done, at least now you will know what to expect and can plan accordingly. Another thing I did to help with the lower and upper abdomen was I bought one of those “Spanx” support garments, which helped quite a bit. Let me know how you are doing (how far along are you now in the process?)</p><p>– I had the procedure done on the morning of Feb. 16, 6 days ago. Eventhough the nurse explained the side effects, swapping out “intense” with “mild” would be more appropriate. As I was going through the procedure, I was thinking “this is nothing.” By Saturday, I was really sore, by Monday I was in pain. Today, I could hardly concentrate to work the pain is so intense. I have on my looses clothes, because anything that even brushes my skin is excrutiating!! I think I will call the doctor to see if I can get something to help the pain. I have read that this could go on for 2 weeks! I am not sure this was less painful than lipo?!?</p><p>– Oh my goodness. I have a consultation with a Dr. next week because I was considering this procedure, but now I’m not sure! Does it really hurt that bad? If so I don’t think I will want to do this. Maybe if I demand that I be prescribed the Neurotin right away? I’m really scared now.</p><p>– 2 weeks later and I am fine, but those first 10 days were doozies. It apparently doesn’t effect everyone and it is usually the abdomen and the larger device when it does happen. Personally, it was bad enough I felt like I might as well have done lipo since I was looking for something painless and it was NOT. It is way too soon to judge the results. So I am going to reserve judgment on whether it was worth it or not.</p><p>– I had my treatment done 6 days ago(1 week tomorrow) on my abdomen….and boy have a hurt!! Some times worse than others, but like u I have had some days that it’s been difficult to make it thru my day. I am glad I did it, but I am really hoping I have good results too, time will tell!</p><p>– Yea I was thinking of doing my abdomen with the larger piece, and my lovehandles. I’m in pretty good shape but no amount of cardio is helping those areas. Ahhh I’m not sure now! Haha ill probably still get it done and just suffer through it. But I definitely want a friggin nerve blocker!</p><p>– I am really pretty thin and, no amount of working out (or losing weight) is going to take care of my belly unless I want to look like a scare crow! I would make sure you have something on hand for the pain which comes on after a couple of days. BTW, the procedure is not painful, just a little strange.</p><p>– I am happy to say that I am back to normal (it has been 9 weeks post procedure). I went back for my after picture yesterday and they were so amazing that the doctor’s office wants to use my pictures for their new brochure! She told me 12 weeks is when people normally see the optimal results. I am going to have the procedure done one more time. 14 weeks post procedure .. She is going to give me Valium before the procedure amd prescribe more Neurontin. At least now I know what to expect and will be “armed and ready” for the pain that comes along with it (hopefully it won’t be as bad, but I am not getting my hopes up).</p><p>– Everything is back to normal for me as well- no more pain or tingling sensation! I am 9 weeks post procedure (had it done February 11). So far I see no difference, but I am very hopeful that I will eventually see results. I also want to get my upper abs done, but i want to wait a little bit longer and see if i get any results on my lower abs</p><p>– Believe it or not, I went back for the other half of the Zeltiq package. The procedure itself went a little better because I knew what to expect (plus, they gave me valium before the procedure and they were willing to prescribe me the Neurontion right away). Well, it has been 6 days and boy am I feeling the pain in the abdomen again!! I must be crazy for going back… I had the abdomen and sides done (2 large panels on the abdomen and two small panels on the sides). Same as before, it is the stabbing pains in the abdomen area (mostly the lower). This had better be worth it!!</p><p>– I initially read these posts about 2 days after having my lower abdomen and love handles done. I have to admit that when I read these posts I thought to myself, “What a buch of sissies!” Well, I couldn’t have been more wrong. At day 5, I was in exactly the same pain as the rest of you! It was nerve pain, just as you all have described. I have had surgery without taking anything more than regular Tylenol. Neurontin (or, used off-label, Horizant) is the only thing that will work on this. Anything topical or anti-inflammitory will be completely ineffective on nerve pain. I agree that doctors should be prepared to write this prescription and not minimize its intensity. I also think that we are NOT in the minority here.</p></div>
