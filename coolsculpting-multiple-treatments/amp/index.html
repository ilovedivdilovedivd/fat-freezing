<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>You can perform Coolscupting in the same area more than twice. We usually separate the treatments by at least 3 months to get your maximum result prior to doing the additional two treatments, but one month would be safe if you were certain you wanted more.</p><p>If the area is stubborn you can combine it with other treatments depending on the area. Kybella will help with the double chin area, radiofrequency tightening like BodyTite with flanks or thighs. (Timothy A. Janiga, MD, FACS, Reno Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are no contraindications for multiple rounds of Coolsculpting , if you need four sessions you may want to consider liposuction instead . Paradoxical hyperplasia will not occur since your previous sessions it did not occur .</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4206" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>We don’t know exactly why PAH occurs , but it’s an all or nothing phenomenon meaning your are either a PAH responder or a non PAH responder and your previous sessions proved your a non PAH responder like the 99.9+% of the rest of patients . (Drew Varano, MD, Washington DC Physician)</p><p><i>Can CoolSculpting be done to the same area more than 3 times?</i></p><p>CoolSculpting can be performed on the same area more than 3 times. There is no maximum number of times that an area can be treated. Each patient is different, so some patients do require more than one treatment session to obtain the desired result.</p><p>I would say having an area treated 4 times is not common but it is possible and I have treated some of my patients in this manner without any problems. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>CoolSculpting Sessions</h4><p>CoolSculpting specifically targets treating an area for one hour total. The entire time is crucial for your treatment and results. The treatment should never vary in time.</p><p>Make sure that this is the CoolSculpting brand system and not a differnt fat reduction treatment.</p><p>My advice, would be to make sure and have an in person consultation with a reputable doctor or CoolSculpting technician and ask for literature or books to view the system and result photos that they have in the office. (Joe Gryskiewicz, MD, FACS, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Re-Treat Coolsculpt</h4><p>Retreating is a great, safe way to achieve a better result in a shorter period of time. I do my second treatments 4 weeks after the first. Then you have the final result sooner!. (Brian K. Reedy, MD, Reading Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4208" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h4>15 minute CoolSculpting sessions</h4><p>The CoolSculpting treatments (by Zeltiq) are an hour per session (except on the outer thigh where it is 2 hours).</p><p>I would not treat someone with six, 15 minute sessions instead of one, 1 hour session. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Wanting “all abdomenal fat gone” can be an unrealistic expectation from any procedure. The larger treatment applicators with CoolSculpting can debulk 20-25% of fat under the skin with each treatment.</p><p>Several treatment cycles may be needed to obtain maximal results, but there are limitations with CoolSculpting. Also, loose skin will not be corrected and can even become more apparent as more and more fat is lost.</p><p>A tummy tuck may still be needed to address excess skin. These considerations and limitations are typically made clear at the consultation when determining if a person is a good candidate for CoolSculpting! (Tina B. West, MD, Washington Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Cool sculpting improves the fat but 20% per treatment, and often requires multiple applicators to be used to get contouring and a few treatments. I suggest a VASER hi definition procedure which gives much more contouring and shaping. (Jason Emer, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting doesn’t prevent you from having surgical procedures in the future. It is a safe and effective way for reduction of fat that requires no downtime. (Robert Whitfield, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting would not prevent you from having surgery in the future if you are in good health and a candidate for surgery. Be sure to see a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon. (Miguel Delgado, MD, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Cryolipolysis is one modality of treatment that is best suited for reducing the profile in specific areas.</p><p>It is not a method of weight loss but can be a valuable adjunct to a programme if devised carefully and with a comprehensive plan. (Tariq Ahmad, MBBChir, FRCS(Plast), Cambridge Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting after surgery?</strong></p><p>I routinely perform Coolsculpting on patients who have recently had surgery. The most important thing is that you are not requiring any medication that would blunt the inflammatory response needed to have positive results with Coolsculpting.</p><p>This would include NSAIDS like Motrin, Advil, Aleve and I would even avoid Tylenol. The inflammatory response following Coolsculpting allows the fat to go into cell death, be broken down and eliminated. (Patrick L. Basile, MD, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There has been no data or evidence stating that you cannot undergo a surgical procedure in the same are as you have had coolsculpting. I would recommend being honest with your surgeon and stating that you have had coolsculpting and where so that he or she can make sure you are completely healed to obtain you best possible results. (Steven H. Dayan, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Double chin / submental fat options</h3><p>Coolsculpting is a great treatment option for the submental fat, aka the double chin. Belkyra (in Canada) or Kybella injections (in the USA) is also a good treatment option for the submental fat. Not everyone is a good candidate for one or both of those options.</p><p>I recommend seeing a an expert for a proper consultation and treatment plan. (Alain Michon, MD, Ottawa Physician)</p><h5>CoolSculpting for neck</h5><p>CoolSculpting can be done on the upper neck (under the chin) to treat excess fat. If there is also excess skin, this issue will not be addressed with CoolSculpting. There are some possible treatment options for excess skin including surgery and non-surgical devices such as radio frequency.(Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting works on submental fat. It doesn’t work on hanging loose skin. I would have a consultation with a board certified facial plastic surgeon who can evaluate the area. (Jeffrey B. Wise, MD, FACS, Wayne Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting can be done under the chin area to take away excess fat. The mini applicator is used for this area. It will only reduce the fat under the chin and won’t do anything to help with sagging skin.</p><p>Therefore, if your issue is more skin laxity, then I would recommend a skin tightening procedure such as Ultherapy or Thermage. It would be best to go in for a consult to see if you area a candidate and which approach is best for you. (Lenore Sikorski, MD, Orange County Dermatologist)</p><h5>Effects of a hot bath after Coolsculpting</h5><p>You can resume any normal activity including a hot bath. A hot bath should feel good as you may be tender from procedure. (Nita Schwartz, MD, Gardnerville Emergency Medicine Physician)</p><p>Your fat cells die during your treatment and therefore this will not have any impact on your results. Please consult with your provider if you have any concerns . (Martin Jugenburg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Bath after Coolsculpting</h5><p>There are no contraindications to taking a hot bath after CoolSculpting. The damage to the fat cells occurred during the CoolSculpting treatment. You can take a bath or shower after your treatment without affecting your results. (Somi Javaid, MD, Cincinnati OB-GYN)</p><p>Having a hot bath two days after the CoolSculpting treatment to your abdomen should not affect your results. In fact, a hot bath anytime after the procedure should not have any impact on the results. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting and Dual sculpting post treatment care</strong></p><p>Hot baths anytime after CoolSculpting is completely fine and are not contraindicated. This will not affect your results. (Alain Michon, MD, Ottawa Physician)</p><p>Taking a hot bath will have no effect on the results of your coolsculpting session. The freezing of fat on your abdomen took place during the coolsculpting session and stops as soon as the applicator is removed.</p><p></p>

</div>Heating the area afterwards does not bring the fat back to life so you are all good. The treatments can be time consuming for large areas so be sure to use Dual Scultping to double the treatment in the same amount of time. (Thomas Buonassisi, MD, Vancouver Facial Plastic Surgeon)
<p>CoolSculpting may take up to 12 weeks to see the full results. After the 3 months, it is possible to retreat an area if necessay. Also, some patients may feel more discomfort on one side after CoolSculpting treatments. (Alain Michon, MD, Ottawa Physician)</p><p><i>Discomfort after coolsculpting and results</i></p><p>The degree of discomfort or not does not effect the results of coolsculpting. Oftentimes patients will have different experiences from one side of the body to the other. There is nothing to worry about. You should see some results in about 3 months. (Jean M. Casello, MD, Northborough Physician)</p><h4>Coolsculpting response</h4><p>The sensation or feeling after Coolsculpting has no correlation to results. Some people may have more numbness or tingling or pain on one side versus another . This is usually due to nerve irritation. Your results should be more noticeable in 1-3 months . (Drew Varano, MD, Washington DC Physician)</p><p>I would recommend waiting 3 months to see the full effect from your treatments and then if there is any difference between the sides, you could always have it retreated then.
