<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The duration of treatment generally depends on the area being treated and how many areas are included in your Treatment to Transformation.</p><p>In general the following treatment times apply:</p><p>– Abdomen – 60 min,<br>
– Love handles, Bra and Back Fat – 60 min,<br>
– Submental – 45 min,<br>
– Outer thigh 75 min.</p><p>However, there are the new Cool Advantage applicators that now cut the time of treatment in half. We anticipate incorporating these applicators very soon. Also, some offices offer something called Dualsculpting where they utilize 2 machines on two different areas to cut treatment time down.</p><p>Unfortunately there are limitation to the dualsculpting process. Two areas opposite each other (ie two abdomen/ abs and flanks) cannot be done together. (Maiysha Clairborne, MD, Atlanta Family Physician)</p><h3>Coolsculpting treatment duration, number of areas</h3><p>Our office now has the newest applicators, where most treatments take 35min per area, and with 2 machines we can sculpt 2 areas at the same time, further decreasing the treatment time duration. Some areas take 45 mins such as the chin and legs.</p><p>Number of treatments needed really depends upon how much stubborn fat you have. An experienced coolsculptor can give you an idea of how many treatments you need. Keep in mind every treatments eliminates 25% of fat at a time. (Shamim Shakibai, MD, Los Angeles Physician)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting Duration and Number of Necessary Treatments</strong></p><p>We have many patients who come in for their consultation asking about the duration of CoolSculpting and the number of treatments needed. Each area of your body requires a one hour treatment session. Depending on the area of your abdomen you’re looking to treat, you may require anywhere from one to four CoolSculpting treatments.</p><p>Many see great results after one session, but you may need two or more to reach your desired look. (Michael Chiaramonte, MD, Washington DC Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Each session lasts approximately 60 minutes, which results in a permanent reduction in the treated area by 20-25%. Sculpt360’s multiple CoolSculpting applicators also enables patients to treat multiple areas simultaneously so that you can maximize your treatment opportunities in the least amount of time!The number of treatments needed is completely dependent on the individual.</p><p>Most patients need about 2-4 sessions til they reach their desired result. (Louis P. Bucky, MD, Philadelphia Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Treatment Time Is an Hour Per Area</em></p><p>Many patients get the results they want after a single treatment session, but having 2 treatments scheduled at least a month apart is pretty common. The duration of a treatment is generally an hour per area.</p><p>CoolSculpting for the abdomen may include both the lower and upper abdomen (2 treatment areas). Also, some providers have more than one CoolSculpting machine, enabling them to treat multiple areas simultaneously. (Katherine A. Orlick, MD, Tucson Dermatologist)</p><p>One CoolSculpting treatment takes approximately 1 hour per cycle. During that cycle to the area being treated, your fat will freeze and over time you will lose approximately 20-25% of fat in that area…permanently!</p><p>We offer Dualsculpting in our practice, so with the use of 2 machines, we can do 2 areas at the same time.</p><p>How many treatments needed depends upon how much fat you have and want to lose. If someone wants to lose twice as much fat to the same area, we will typically have you return in 6 weeks for your second treatment.</p><p>Most importantly though, is beginning with a proper assessment of the area and recommending the number of treatments needed to provide you with the best contouring results. With 6 different hand pieces to use for your treatment, we pride ourselves on our knowledge and expertise in this area for best results. (Emerico Csepanyi, MD, Newport Beach Physician)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting duration of treatment</strong></p><p>CoolSculpting treatments take 1 hour per area but can be done together if you have 2 machines. Other areas can also be done at the same time so some patients may be in the office for several hours. Some patients see results in just 1 treatment but we recommend 2 treatments on average. For larger areas, multiple treatments may be necessary. (Kurtis Martin, MD, Cincinnati Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Duration of coolsculpting results</b></p><p>Coolsculpting is a novel approach to the treatment of fat. It works by freezing the fat cells which then caused them to die without leaving any scarring. They can be done in the office with no down time.</p><p>The results are permanent by decreasing the total number of fat cells in that area. t does not mean that she cannot gain weight in that area but rather a more proportional weight would be gained. (Chad K. Wheeler, MD, Spokane Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Coolsculpting Duration</h5><p>The fat cells that are eliminated do no come back. Each treatment will remove approximately 20% of the fat in a given area so the number of treatments in a given treatment depends on the level of improvement a patient seeks. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>How long does CoolSculpting take?</i></p><p>One CoolSculpting treatment takes 35-60 minutes per area treated. One area is typically about the size of your hand. So, each love handle would be considered one area, and the lower abdomen is typically considered two areas, though every person is different.</p><p>So, 2 areas could take a little over an hour (the chin takes about an hour). A second treatment in the same area may be beneficial since CoolSculpting removes about 25-30% of the fat cells per treatment.</p><p>The fat that is lost is gone permanently. Typical results take 3 weeks to 3 months to see. (Mike Majmundar, MD, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting offers an average of a 25% reduction in the treated area. You will need to have a consultation in person to determine how many treatments you will need. Keeping in mind the name of the procedure, it is the doctors job to show you how they can “sculpt” your body to the desired shape.</p><p>Depending on how many you need, you may be able to treat all locations in one day, and then follow up in a couple of months to see if you need more. (Janet Allenby, DO, Delray Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>CoolSculpting Results and Treatments Vary on Individual</h3><p>Each CoolSculpting® treatment area is treated in approximately one hour. For example, patients who treat both flanks or both sides of the lower back will take two hours since each area requires one hour. However, some practices offer DualSculpting™ which utilizes two CoolSculpting® applicators to reduce treatment times.</p><p>As for the number of treatments, each person’s body reacts differently to the procedure since the body naturally eliminates the affected, frozen fat cells through its lymphatic system.</p><p>Most patients can see results after one treatment, but some may choose additional treatments to maximize results.</p><p>It is important to consult a board certified plastic surgeon who has experience working with CoolSculpting® non-invasive fat reduction to determine a proper treatment plan. (C. Edwin Pittman, MD, Athens Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Each CoolSculpting treatment will last one hour, with the exception of the outer thighs, which will last for 75 minutes. One area could be an applicator that’s the size of your hand, or one that is 2.5 times that size. Only a certified CoolSculpting professional can properly assess and then give a treatment plan for what applicators will fit each part of your body.</p><p>Coolsculpting causes a natural cell death that permanently removed the affected fat cells.</p><p>The only reason to see these fat cells return would be in the case of weight gain. (Thomas McFadden, MD, Greenville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting treatement times</strong></p><p>Coolsculpting is a non-surgical body contouring using a special device that will cool the tissues to a point where fat cells will die-off over time without any damage to skin or other tissues. The procedure involves anywhere from from 2 to 8 applications of the Coolsculpting device which is not painful.</p><p>The entire procedure can take anywhere from 1 hour to 2.5 hours depending on the number of areas treated. It is performed in a comfortable room where you are laying down and can even take a nap while the procedure is being performed.</p><p>The more areas treated the better the result. Some patients may require a second treatment one to three months later. (Shahriar Mabourakh, MD, FACS, Sacramento Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>CoolSculpting by Zeltiq gives permanent fat reduction – Procedure takes one hour</h4><p>We have been performing CoolSculpting since February of 2010 and have witnessed permanent fat reduction in all the areas treated. On average, patients lose 20 to 25% of the fat with each treatment, although some patients may see up to a 40% or greater reduction.</p><p>Even when in some cases the patient may have had some weight gain in general since the treatment, the area that was treated with CoolSculpting remains reduced. The actual treatment lasts one hour, per applicator or treatment area.</p><p>For example, to treat an abdoment may be anywhere from one to two hours, love handles are one hour each, and similarly for thighs and other areas. (Leyda Elizabeth Bowes, MD, Miami Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Coolsculpting Treatment Time and Results.</h3><p>When first introduced, Coolsculpting required one hour per treatment area. The applicators had to be in contact with the fat for one hour of controlled freezing to get results. Recently, Zeltiq has improved their applicators with the introduction of CoolAdvantage.</p><p>These redesigned applicators cover more fat, are more comfortable and treatment time has been reduced to 35 minutes! This means two areas cam now be treated compared to the time of one of the old applicators.</p><p>Remember, during the Coolsculpting treatment you can read, work, watch TV, etc. You will see results from Coolsculpting in 2-4 months. The results are permanent as long as you maintain your weight or better, lose weight.</p><p>You can expect a 25% reduction in the fatty area treated. If you want more, another Coolsculpting procedure can easily be done for even better results!. (Lawrence Broder, MD, Cedar Park Family Physician)</p></div>
