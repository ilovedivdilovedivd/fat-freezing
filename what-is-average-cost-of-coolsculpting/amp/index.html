<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The cost for CoolSculpting is based on the number of areas treated. There is a per area cost that ranges on average between $600-750.</p><p>The cost per area decreases as the number of area that require treatment increases. Some patients require two treatment sessions separated by a couple months for an optimal outcome.</p><p>You should anticipate your initial consultation to take approximately one hour at which time you will be measured, assessed and photographed. Seek out a CoolSculpting Certified office/practitioner. (Nicholas Tarola, MD, Nashville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost depends on the size of the area treated and how many cycles are necessary.</p><p>For example, a lower abdomen may require only 1 cycle while a larger one may require 2 cycles. Depending on the size of the patient, and the desired result, the decision to repeat CoolSculpting could add to the price.</p><p>I would be very cautious of any facility that was far below the average price of others in the area.</p><p>Remember that this treatment can leave beautiful, long-lasting results in trained hands, however, permanent contour irregularities can arise if performed incorrectly or without proper training. (Renee Burke, MD, Barrington Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting is a great way to reduce unwanted fat without anesthesia, surgery or downtime. Treatment sessions are usually about an hour in duration, making it possible to fit into your lunch break.</p><p>The cost of the procedure depends on your goals and the number of areas you want to treat. Although a single treatment does reduce the amount fat in that area, most patients need more than one treatment to be satisfied with the result.</p><p>The average price reported on realself is between 1500-2000. This is also true in my practice. (Bradley A. Hubbard, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Coolscultping Price</b></p><p>CoolSculpting is a FDA cleared, non-invasive treatment for spot treating subcutaneous fat. Patients can expect to pay a range of $750-1500 per treatment.</p><p>We recommend on average 2-8 applications depending on the size and location of the desired area for treatment.</p><p>When choosing a CoolSculpting provider make sure that you have a proper evaluation. Patients who get the most transformative results have been fully assessed and given a comprehensive treatment plan. Now with faster treatment times, reduced discomfort and zero downtime CoolSculpting is better than ever. (Margaret Boyse, MD, Raleigh-Durham Physician)</p><p>There are 2 hand pieces and each one has a different cost. The smaller hand piece can be used on areas such as the flanks, thighs, back, abdomen, and sometimes arms. The larger hand piece can be used on the abdomen for larger areas.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_31" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Sometimes multiple treatments with the smaller hand piece are required, depending on the area.</p><p>It is best to get a consultation to obtain accurate pricing. The average usually is $700-$850 for the smaller hand piece and $1300-$1600 for the larger hand piece.</p><p>This procedure is a non-invasive, no downtime procedure and is a great non surgical alternative for fat reduction. (Steven H. Williams, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting Costs in Minneapolis are affordable, the average price $750 -$1000</i></p><p>Treatment pricing per patient varies due to area of treatment and number of treatments recommended to obtain best results.</p><p>Our pricing structure is discussed with each patient, noted on our website and service menu, and is again reitereated during your consultation.</p><p>The average price per treatment for our patient is $750. Most patients are choosing more than a single treatment and or treat an area that requires the use of more than one applicator (i.e. love handles, lower abdomen).</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_32" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>We find the average cost for patients full treatment package range $750- $3000, depending upon number of areas and treatments for their best results.</p><p>Consultations are complimentary and are a great way to learn more about CoolSculpting.</p><p>It is always encouraged to start with a visit to know your options for reducing unwanted fat and to be confident in the cost of your treatment. (Gregory Mesna, MD, FACS, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Patient factors best determine cost</b></p><p>CoolSculpt patients will pay for “cycles” to treat their particular areas of concern. What a cycle is is basically a small area that is treatable by one of the CoolSculpt applicators.</p><p>While the price per cycle ($750 or $1500 depending on the applicator used) is protected by Zeltiq, the number of cycles needed per patient will vary.</p><p>The best way to determine your total cost would be to have a consultation appointment with a provider. During your visit, the provider can perform an exam, discuss your concerns and desired outcomes, and answer any questions that you have.</p><p>At that point the provider can then let you know how many cycles would likely be needed to accomplish your goals. Keep in mind that each patient may respond differently and an average of 20-30% reduction in the fat cells in the area treated is a reasonable expectation.</p><p>Some patients may need to have a second cycle done on areas with more fullness (i.e. the abdomen). The possibility of the need for more cycles should be reviewed during the consultation visit. (Theodore Staahl, MD, Modesto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of CoolSculpting by Zeltiq in Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, Encino, and the San Fernando Valley</h3><p>The average cost of CoolScultping by Zeltiq in the Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, Encino, and San Fernando Valley area is ~$750 per area for the smaller hand piece and ~$1500 for the large hand piece. If multiple areas or multiple treatments are necessary, then some physicians will discount the treatment.</p><p>CoolSculpting by Zeltiq is safe and effective for treating unwanted fat bulges that are resistant to diet and exercise. (Michael A. Persky, MD, Encino Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Coolsculpting pricing in Atlanta</strong></p><p>Coolsculpting pricing varies depending on the person but in reality pricing from practice to practice is protected by the manufacturer.</p><p>You do save some if you have multiple areas or if you go to an event at the practice but, in general, it’s best to get a consult with a Coolsculpting provider to see what areas need to be treated to get a good result instead of a good price.</p><p>A provider that has performed at least a thousand treatments and is trained by CoolSculpting University is the best person to give you the best analysis and treatment plan. Our treatment provider has performed over 3500 coolsculpting procedures so this experience is in your favor.</p><p>On average, treatments run $1200-$3400 for most patients but, again, it depends on the number of areas desired to be treated. (Mike Majmundar, MD, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>The cost of stubborn fat removal…</h5><p>While cost is definitely a factor to consider, it shouldn’t be everything. Seek out a trained and qualified professional in the industry that has the experience to deliver the best possible results.</p><p>Anyone can set diagnostics into a machine, but only a handful could choose those manually and know why they’re selecting the As far as cost is concerned, this will vary depending on the treatment area and sessions required.</p><p>On average, the cost of treatment will start at $750 CAD and go up with larger/greater treatment areas. Make sure that you attend a consultation before any treatment begins. During that consultation you should be taught about the procedure thoroughly, including pre- and post-treatment protocol and everything in-between.</p><p>The recommendation to go ahead with CoolSculpting should be genuine, and not just because the machine is the only option available at the office. (Thomas Buonassisi, MD, Vancouver Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>How much does coolsculpting cost</strong></p><p>Coolsculpting costs do vary by geography and body site treated. There are also now 2 size applicators, large and standard and each have different prices. On average, nationally, the large applicator fees can range from 1200-1600 and the standard applicators can range from 600-750.</p><p>This prices are per application. (Lori A. Brightman, MD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p></div>
