<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>In my practice I offer both CoolSculpting and tumescent liposuction, and I believe that each has wonderful applications. Liposuction ultimately allows the most control in contouring as it is easy to work my way around the whole body including areas like arms, abdomen, back, hips, thighs and knees.</p><p>CoolSculpting can be done on many of the individual areas that you may be a candidate for liposuction for but is more of a solution for smaller trouble areas as opposed to a total body makeover type of solution.</p><p>CoolSculpting does eliminate many of the risks associated with anesthesia and surgery in general which means that for individuals with particular trouble areas that they are looking to address it can be an incredible option. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>LIPOsuction is the gold standard for fat removal </i></p><p>A machine or device cannot replicate a skilled liposuction operator. However, if you are looking for a non-invasive option to get rid of fat, this is an exceptional technology that has proven itself over time.</p><p>In my practice, I perform both cool sculpting and LIPO. For some people cool sculpting Is a great option, while other people prefer LIPO. I guess it depends if you want the fat transferred to another part of the body such as what is done with a BBL. (Sameer Bashey, MD, Beverly Hills Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Comparing Coolsculpting to Smart lipo for contouring and fat reduction for live handles and belly fat.</h3><p>Both Coolsculpting and smart lipo are very effective to reduce belly fat and love handles. If the amount of belly fat is small and the tummy area has good contour, Coolsculpting can do a great job to reduce belly fat without any down time.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1000" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>If you have extra fat in the upper, mid and lower belly it is often less expensive and it takes less time to achieve your goals when I use smart lipo which is minimally invasive but does require some downtime.</p><p>I use the same logic when I council patients on options for reducing fat and contouring love handles. Often times the love handle fat is dense and does not respond well with Coolsculpting. Its always’s best to consult an ABMS certified Plastic surgeon who can help you understand all your options to reduce belly fat and love handle fat. (Laurie A. Casas, MD, FACS, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Slim Lipo VS CoolSculpting</b></p><p>The difference between Slim Lipo and CoolSculpting is the type of procedure. Slim Lipo is surgical and invasive which requires incisions, numbing, more discomfort, and more downtime. CoolSculpting is non-surgical, non-invasive, and there is no downtime required.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1001" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>The results tend to look more natural and smooth. After a CoolSculpting treatment, you can return to your normal activities while after any surgical procedure like Slim Lipo, you need to take medication and disrupt your day-to-day life.</p><p>If you’re looking for a safe and comfortable treatment to eliminate fat, CoolSculpting is perfect for you. (Daljeet Samra, MD, Pleasanton Physician)</p><p><b>Medical Weight Loss + Fat Reducing Technology</b></p><p>For anyone with significant weight to lose, I’d recommend beginning with medically supervised weight loss, then following with CoolSculpting. Medically supervised weight loss involves optimizing nutrition, supplements and medications to remove as much weight as possible BEFORE undergoing external sculpting.</p><p>As such, you will need fewer CoolSculpting treatments! (Joseph A. Eviatar, MD, FACS, New York Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Slim lip of and Coolsculpting are completely different treatments</strong></p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1002" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Slim lip of and Coolsculpting are completely different treatments. Slim lipo is invasive and is more akin to traditional liposuction.</p><p>Coolsculpting is non-invasive. The candidates are completely different too. Slim lipo can remove larger areas of fat and has downtime.</p><p>Coolsculpting is better for smaller localized areas of fat and has no downtime. You should have a consult to get accurate pricing and see what makes more sense for your body. (William Kwan, MD, FAAD, San Francisco Dermatologist)</p><p>I have performed a great deal of tumescent liposuction over the years and was very excited when CoolSculpting’s technology was developed by Zeltiq. Not all patients who are candidates for liposuction want to undergo surgery.</p><p>Not all patients who want to have liposuction are considered candidates for surgery as they may have a medical condition or take medications that would prevent us from doing the liposuction. Some paitents have a small bulge and it doesn’t warrant the risks of the liposcution procedure.</p><p>Patients who are interested in CoolSculpting are told by me in the consultation, that liposuction is more effective in removing the fat and that it may only be one surgery, although some patients do need to have a secondary procedure to improve lumps or depressions.</p><p>Only after knowing the whole story and alternatives and how many treatments and cost, along with the risks, can a patient wisely choose what is best for them. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Coolsculpting vs. Slim Lipo for Belly fat and Love Handles, which one is better?</i></p><p>1. If an individual has significant amounts of abdominal fat and love handles accompanied by a high BMI, the person has to consider losing weight before getting either procedure. The person has to maintain a healthy lifestyle after receiving the treatment.</p><p>2. Liposuction is a surgically invasive procedure that can eliminate more than 25% of fat from your body, and has risks of infection, hematoma, scars, bleeding, sepsis, complications due to anesthesia, such as lidocaine toxicity, and in some cases death.</p><p>3. The discomfort and the downtime is lot less with Coolsculpting, and results are seen after 2 to 3 months. Coolsculpting may require more than one session to reduce more than 25% of the fat. The risk of infection, scars and death are unknown with Coolsculpting. (Shanthala Shivananjappa, MD, Boston Physician)</p><h4>New Options for Belly Fat – CoolSculpting</h4><p>CoolSculpting is an appealing technology and procedure because it avoids anesthesia and immediate recovery time. It is best used in patients who have good overall core body contour with the exception of fatty excess of the lower abdomen and love handle area.</p><p>Ideally a patient will be satisfied with a single treatment or possibly two, thus making it cost effective as well. If a patient needs or wants a greater contour change than the anticipated 25% reduction, then the patient is better off considering liposuction.</p><p>The “best” treatment always is the procedure which is going to give the patient her anticipated change. Consult with a qualified plastic surgeon who has Cool Sculpting and who performs liposuction to fully understand which technique will achieve your desired results. (Carlin Vickery, MD (retired), New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Slim Lipo vs. Cool Sculpting</h5><p>Slim Lipo is a type of laser assisted liposuction. This is a surgical procedure that requires small incisions, infiltration of tumescent solution, laser delivery via a “wand” and then liposuction to remove the fat cells.</p><p>Again, this is a surgical procedure and the outcome is going to greatly depend on the skill of the surgeon you have chosen. Cool Sculpting is a non-surgical procedure used to remove fat in targeted areas.</p><p>It requires multiple treatments and has varied results. Some people respond very well to non-invasive fat reduction, while others do not. Visit an experienced plastic surgeon who performs both liposuction and Cool Sculpting to get better recommendations on which is best for you.
