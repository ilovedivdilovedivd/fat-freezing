<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Depends upon what you mean by effective? If you mean simply removing the same amount of fat, then probably not. Liposuction will usually remove more fat.</p><p>If you mean aesthetic result, then definitely not! Someone experienced in liposculpture understands how to remove fat selectively from the differently layers of fat to give you a more defined appearance.</p><p>It is not how much fat your remove, but what you leave behind that matters most. Now that said, I have Coolsculpting in my practice and love it! For the right patient, it is an excellent option. (Mark D. Epstein, MD, Stony Brook Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Cryolipolysis is a non-surgical alternative to traditional liposuction. While it does not mimic the results, it is suggested to treat the targeted area to achieve the results you want.</p><p>CoolSculpting is for those who wish to seek an alternative to liposuction. CoolSculpting will give you no downtime and instant recovery to go about your daily activities. Also you will avoid any internal scarring with coolsculpting which may occur with traditional liposuction. (Daljeet Samra, MD, Livermore Physician)</p><p>Both Coolsculpting and liposuction can be used effectively for body contouring. However, every patient is different and not everyone is a candidate for either procedure. Coolsculpting is non-invasive, usually requires more than one treatment, and results are typically evident by three months.</p><p>Liposuction can have a much more dramatic result, although it can take at least three to six months to see the ultimate effect.</p><p>In order to get a qualified, ethical, and expert opinion on your surgical options and expectations, schedule an in-person office consultation with a plastic surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. (Keith M. Blechman, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Your liposuction results won’t be finalized until 6 months. At that point you can reassess. It is normal to have some lumps and bumps at 2 months post liposuction.</p><p>Coolsculpting should not be necessary , If there is a small amount of residual fat , then coolsculpting offer an excellent non surgical option for removing a small amount of residual fat.</p><p>Achieving a flat stomach may or may not be possible depending on your original stature. Other issues to consider depend If you have good muscle tone, good skin tone/elasticity ( no stretch marks or loose skin) and limited visceral fat , reasonable bmi are all factors which determine final outcome.</p><p>Coolscupting won’t affect these factors. (Drew Varano, MD, Washington DC Physician)</p><p>Abdominal contouring with nonsurgical treatments such as cool sculpting or sculpSure have very specific indications and are excellent treatments for nonsurgical minded patients</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4049" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>For individuals who are more interested in a significant change or a faster results are looking often to either skin excision with Tummy Tuck procedures or fat reduction with liposuction.</p><p>Not all liposuction procedures are the same however Consider the wide range of liposuction procedures that spans from office-based laser Liposuction such as SmartLipo all the way up to high volume liposuction removal in the hospital.</p><p>Sometimes a touch up with a non-surgical device such as cool sculpting or SculpSure is an excellent adjunct following a surgical procedure such as Liposuction. (R. Brannon Claytor, MD, FACS, Bryn Mawr Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I am a plastic surgeon so therefore I love surgery but there is always a place for non invasive procedures. I tell everyone that it depends how much fat needs to be removed and how many areas.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4050" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>If it is extensive with multiple areas to be targeted and the patient has some downtime and is willing to undergo surgery, then liposuction is for them. If the patient wants no downtime, minimal fat reduction per session and minimal to no pain and downtime, then coolsculpting is for you! (Payman Danielpour, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting is a great non surgical, non invasive and effective treatment to get rid of stubborn fat. Up to 25 % reduction of fat cells per treatment area. Keep in mind Coolsculpting is not a weight loss solution.</p><p>However, by starting with a few treatments cycles, it may give you the confidence and drive to continue a proper diet, exercising and live a better lifestyle. More cycles can be done afterward if needed. (Alain Michon, MD, Ottawa Physician)</p><p>For changes that can stimulate you to continue to improve you diet, exercise and overall lifestyle I choose to use CoolSculpting. It can reduce an area by up to 25% with only an hour of treatment. (Robert Whitfield, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting is a great non-surgical procedure for small pockets of fat that diet and exercise don’t seem to affect. CoolSculpting will reduce 20% to 25% per treated area per treatment and the results will not be evident for several weeks as the fat cells that have been frozen are shed by the body.</p><p>Liposuction is a great procedure for larger amounts of fat removal and can all be done at the same time, but it is a surgical procedure which will require recovery time. See a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon who will be able to help you decide what your best option is dependent on your goals. (Miguel Delgado, MD, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4052" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><b>Best results for fat removal are with liposuction</b></p><p>Coolsculpting requires multiple attachments to get all the areas of concern to you. With one procedure, it call all be done with liposuction and with better results. Coolsculpting has no downtime and a good procedure for areas which have “pinchable fat”.</p><p>It is only fair at doing arms and lipo is much better. I’d see a specialist that does Vaser lipo. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting vs Lipo for upper arms</strong></p><p>Coolsculpting melts fat cells but it does not treat sagging skin. You would benefit from coolsculpting but you may need additional treatments to address your sagging skin. You will need more than one treatment of coolsculpting to achieve visible results.</p><p>Maybe liposuction would yield you significant improvement faster, but it would require some downtime. On the other hand, coolsculpting would require two-three treatments spaced out by 2-3 months and it takes around 3 months to see end results after each treatment.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4053" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Anyhow, after coolsculpting there is no to minimal downtime and coolsculpting is noninvasive. Still, you would require additional treatments for sagging skin after coolsculpting procedure, such as trusculpt, ultherapy, or other RF treatment. I advise you to make an appointment with experienced plastic surgeon to get informed and make right decision how to proceed and what treatments to choose. (Hardik Soni, MD, Summit Emergency Medicine Physician)</p><h4>CoolSculpting Underarm Fat</h4><p>The only legitimate way to determine if you are a good CoolSculpting candidate for reducing under arm fat is to schedule an in-person consolation with a certified CoolSculpting provider. With that said, your situation may be ideal for CoolSculpting, which is designed for individuals who are in relatively good shape but struggle with stubborn fat deposits that resist diet and exercise.</p><p>The underarm area is notorious for collecting stubborn fat, especially with women, and I have seen a surge of demand for CoolSculpting on this area of the body. CoolSculpting has developed two applicators that are commonly used to treat this area.</p><p>The CoolFit and the CoolMini. The Coolfit applicator has a long, slim design, allowing it to easily attach to the arms and legs. The CoolMini is FDA approved for reducing submental fat, commonly known as a double chin, but the small size of the applicator makes it effective at treating fat deposits around the armpits, commonly known as bra bulge.</p><p>You may also want to ask your CoolSculpting provider about a non-invasive skin tightening treatment, such as Thermage, which may help tighten your underarm area once you have completed your CoolSculpting treatments. (Hadley Claire King, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p><strong>Cool sculpting vs liposuction of the arms</strong></p><p>Assuming the skin has good elasticity liposuction (done by an experienced plastic surgeon) would definitely give a more dramatic result than coolsculpting. In all cases, coolsculpting is a less aggressive procedure than liposuction, the benefit being no surgery and essentially no downtime. (York Jay Yates, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Banana roll after liposuction, can Coolsculpting help?</strong></p><p>I think that is a great idea to use Coolsculpting to this area. I don’t Velashape will change things much. This is one of the best areas to treat with Coolsculpting. Cooladvantage and Z Wave will give even better results with your Coolsculpting. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The banana roll can be treated with CoolSculpting if this doesn’t go away after swelling is gone.</p><p>Our office has had great results with CoolSculpting that area. Make sure to see a Certified CoolSculpting Specialist to see if you are a good candidate. (Jeffrey M. Hartog, DMD, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
