<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><strong>CoolSculpting results last indefinitely. Number of treatments recommended are often more than 1.</strong></p><p>CoolSculpting is destroying fat cells through cryolipolysis, and the affected cells will naturally be removed from your system over the course of weeks following each treatment.</p><p>During your consultation for CoolSculpting, the number of treatments recommended will be provided, and in most cases, multiple treatments are recommended for optimal results.</p><p>The results of each treatment should reduce the fatty layer 20-25%, and most commonly, 2-3 treatments are encouraged.</p><p>These treatments can be spaced as frequent as 4 weeks apart, to further speed the process and enjoy end results which happen over the course of 2-4 months.</p><p>The treatment itself takes one hour per application, and if more than one handpiece applicator is involved, it is one hour per applicator.</p><p>I Maintaining healthy lifestyle and weight are best defense in keeping the results satisfactory.</p><p>CoolSculpting is a fantastic alternative to surgical procedures and well-worth investigating if you’re a good candidate. (Gregory Mesna, MD, FACS, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Are CoolSculpting Results Permanent </b></p><p>The fat cells that are destroyed by the treatment are permanently expelled from the body and will never return. This is identical to the effect of having the surgical fat removal procedure, liposuction.</p><p>CoolSculpting is not meant to be a remedy for weight loss or future weight gain. The remaining fat cells in the treated area can expand with lack of exercise and poor diet, which can cause your result to be compromised. (Vinay Aggarwal, MD, Los Angeles Physician)</p><p><i>How long does CoolSculpting last and how many treatments do you need?</i></p><p>As long as you maintain a healthy diet and exercise, the results of Coolsculpting are permanent. The number of treatments vary depending on your body shape and ultimate goals. Coolsculpting consultations with an experienced practitioner are very thorough.</p><p>Your practitioner will be able to develop a customized treatment plan based on your needs and provide you with realistic expectations following your procedure. (Warren B. Seiler III, MD, Birmingham Physician)</p><h5>Lasting Results</h5><p>The length of your session may vary depending on how many areas you want to be treated in one visit. On average, one area can take from 35-60 minutes. The amount of treatments conducted depends on the area of treatment and the goals for your body.</p><p>Typically, you will undergo one treatment per area at a given session and SculptMD can. (Daljeet Samra, MD, Pleasanton Physician)</p><p>The CoolSculpting procedure normally takes 35 minutes and results are lasting. Research is constantly being done to evaluate if patients continue to see results. Recently one study showed an individual had great results 9 years after treatment.</p><p>Because the fat cells that are treated die off, they are gone for good. The remaining fat cells are able to grow and expand, but the ones effected by the treatment are eliminated. Every person is different in regards to the number of treatments needed.</p><p>This can depend on the size and contour of your body, as well as what areas you want treated. We advise you to seek consultation to discover the areas of opportunity for treatment and how many treatments you need to see the desired results. (Laura Marsh, MD, Bryan Family Physician)</p><p>Many patients are excited to see the results after having coolsculpting. The science behind coolsculpting is incredible and promises 25% reduction in the fat cell present in the area treated.</p><p>You should allow up to three months to see the ultimate results. It is recommended to follow up after treatment in 4 – 6 weeks and for best results pending on your expectations you may be told initially if one or two treatments would be recommended to get the ultimate transformation you are looking for and remember your investment in your health and your body deserves only the best food’s that means no process foods and cut back on sugars to keep the fat cells in check. (Rosalind Jackson, MD, Miamisburg OB-GYN)</p><p>A CoolSculpting procedure lasts for an hour for each area treated; at my practice, we have two machines that can be used at the same time to cut procedure time in half when treating two sides of the body.</p><p>How long CoolSculpting results will last depends on the individual person and their lifestyle. If you maintain a healthy lifestyle following treatment and maintain your weight, results can last indefinitely. CoolSculpting freezes the fat cells in the area treated, and destroys them so that they don’t return.</p><p>The remaining fat cells in the area can always get larger if one gains weight, but otherwise, once you have the reduction in fat cells you stay slim in that area. One treatment is generally needed for good results; with approximately 30 to 40% fat reduction if that area is also massaged afterwards with the Zwave device.</p><p>You may want more reduction, so after a 2-3 month wait, the same area can be retreated if desired. I suggest discussing your goals with your dermatologist to find out how many treatments it will take for you to reach them. (Kimberly Butterwick, MD, San Diego Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>CoolSculpting Treatments</h3><p>CoolSculpting treatments can range anywhere from 35 minutes to 75 minutes, per session, depending on the area treated and applicator used. The newer technology for most areas of the body are 35 minutes per treatment so one area of the body could total 70 minutes in one sitting.</p><p>Most patients need at least 2 treatments per area to see the best results and the results are permanent. CoolSculpting is a fat removal procedure so once the fat has been removed from an area it is gone for good.</p><p>Keep in mind should you gain weight the fat can go to other areas of the body that have not been treated. Your best bet is to contact a certified CoolSculpting practice to have a consultation as they will give you the best treatment plan for you.</p><p>Everyone responds differently to this procedure so something personalized for your body type will get you the best results. (Randolph Capone, MD, FACS, Baltimore Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Results are permanent but will need more than one session</i></p><p>the amazing thing about this technology is that not only is it noninvasive, the results are permanent because there is a permanent loss of those fat cells in the treated area. Most people will need more than one session, depending on the body part treated people may need two to four sessions. (Sameer Bashey, MD, Beverly Hills Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Permanent Fat Reduction in 1 Hour</h4><p>Each coolsculpting treatment cycle takes one hour. This results in about 20-25% fat loss in the treated area. Multiple cycles can also be performed in the same day, so you don’t necessarily mean you have to make multiple trips to the doctor’s office.</p><p>The number of cycles needed really depends on how many areas are treated and your personal goals. Coolsculpting can be used to treat love handles, inner and outer thighs, debulk and sculpt the abdomen. Patients will often do 1-2 cycles per area. (Adam J. Mamelak, MD, Austin Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>CoolSculpting Results</b></p><p>Most CoolSculpting treatments take one hour for each area treated. The new CoolSmooth applicator requires a two hour treatment. This new applicator can target the outer thighs and abdomen, areas that may not have been treatable previously with CoolSculpting.</p><p>Due to the flat design of the new applicator, the area treated is not drawn away from the underlying tissues. These underlying tissues hold heat. Due to the proximity of the treated area to the warm underlying tissues, a two hour treatment is required to achieve the temperatures to induce results.</p><p>With each CoolSculpting treatment, you can expect a 20-25% fat reduction. Even better, this fat reduction is permanent! The cold temperature of CoolSculpting induces a programmed cell death, apoptosis, of the treated fat cells. Over the next two months, these fat cells are excreted from the body through the lymphatic and circulatory systems.</p><p>If you maintain your weight within a reasonable range, you can expect permanent results to the treated area. Your CoolSculpting specialist can evaluate your needs and determine the best treatment plan for your body type. (Kent V. Hasen, MD, Naples Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Coolsculpting Results</h5><p>It takes 35 minutes per cycle. In the past, it used to take an hour. You can have more than one handpiece at a time or do it sequentially. It may take 3 weeks-6 months to see results but the results are long-lasting.</p><p>Most clients need 1-2 treatments to see results, but some require more. It really depends on how much you need to lose initially. (Justin Harper, MD, Columbus Physician)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting Procedure and Number of Treatments Required</i></p><p>The procedure itself is only one hour per area treated.</p><p>For instance, if you are treating both sides of your flanks, each side will take one hour for a total of two hours for both sides.</p><p>Most people only require one treatment, while some prefer to do a second treatment to further enhance their results. You can expect about 20-25% reduction in fat with a single treatment and that is usually very noticeable to most people, especially with the use of before and after photos.</p><p>Results can take 2-3 months to be seen. CoolSculpting is a non-invasive, no downtime treatment that is a great nonsurgical way to reduce fat. (Steven H. Williams, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
