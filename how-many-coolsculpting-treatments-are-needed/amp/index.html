<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>It is impossible to give you a specific answer because each patient will have individual needs. It is important that you have a consultation so that your target areas can be seen and examined.</p><p>Your expectations and goals are very important in determining what will be best for you. Best results occur when each target area is treated at least twice with the two treatments being done about one month apart.</p><p>it is common to evaluate the results approximately two months after that second treatment.</p><p>Most treatments to the abdomen will require from two to four applications of the treatment head for each session that is done.

</div>Though the abdomen is one of the most popular areas of the body that patients opt in to treat; CoolSculpting is very patient specific which makes it extremely difficult to make an accurate determination of how many treatments would be required without physically seeing you in person.
<p>You want to make sure that you are being assessed in-person as opposed to being provided recommendations over the phone as once you arrive the treatment plan could change. (Calvin Wilson, MD, Philadelphia OB-GYN)</p><p>Treatments of larger areas are very common, however, you will require multiple sessions for the same area spaced thirty days apart. Coolsculpting can help you get closer to your goal, however, each treatment kills 20% – 30% of the fat cells per treatment versus liposuction which can eliminate more cells in a single session. (Christa Clark, MD, FACS, Sacramento Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>CoolSculpting Results</h4><p>Results with CoolSculpting can take time. CoolSculpting can be very effective for the right candidate. It is important for patients to be evaluated by a board certified plastic surgeon who has experience in the different body sculpting methods available to ensure that you are receiving the best treatment plan for your individual needs. (Christine Sullivan, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Although results can be seen after one treatment it typically is necessary to treat each area twice. The minimum time between treatments is 30 days. Areas can also be treated and then an adjacent area can be treated right after the first.</p><p>The love handle is an excellent example of an area that can be treated this way. We perform Dual Sculpting at the Upper Room in Austin with two devices to save you time! (Robert Whitfield, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4247" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>Coolsculpting treatments and getting the best results</h3><p>Coolsculpting is definitely a cosmetic procedure that requires medical knowledge and expertise. In fact, Coolsculpting was invented by two dermatologists at Harvard and the technology was developed and tested by dermatologists. I would advised seeing a physician’s office where the doctor is involved in the process. (Omar Ibrahimi, MD, PhD, Stamford Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Time interval</h3><p>The time interval between treatments varies depending on your goals. You can approach it two ways. If you know you will need at least 2 treatments to get the results you want then doing them a month apart makes sense because you will improve your results with another 20-25% of fat cells killed.</p><p>You have the benefit of seeing results sooner than waiting the 3-4 months and then doing a second treatment. The coolsculpting will not affect the body’s ability to remove the previously killed fat cells. If you only have a small amount of fatty tissue in an area and you dont know if you will need a second treatment then you can wait until you see your full results, about 4 month, and decide. (Michelle J. Place, MD, Danville Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4248" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>Is Coolsculpting for you?</h3><p>If thighs are your concern, the CoolSmooth Pro applicator for your outer thighs will likely be a helpful procedure. Because the CoolSmooth Pro applicator utilizes flat panels that can conform to the body, it is ideal for the outer thighs where suction applicators may not be. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>After Coolsculpting to back, concerned about results</h5><p>Paradoxical adipose hyperplasia is extremely rare and doesn’t happen this early. There can be some swelling associated with the procedure. If there is any concern, please speak with your provider. In general, Coolsculpting is a very safe and effective procedure. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Coolscupting buttocks</h3><p>Typically is takes about 3 months to see the results of coolsculpting. If it has been several months from your treatment it may be that you need to be treated again with different placement of the applicator.</p><p>If you just had the treatment the mark from the applicator should fade. Adipose hyperplasia is a rare side effect from coolscupting. It has been reported when treating breast tissue. I have been offering coolscupting for about 10 years and have never seen this complication. (Jean M. Casello, MD, Northborough Physician)</p><p>Coolsculpting definitely works. If you can grab the area to treat within your hand then you can have enough fat to treat. If you look for a Plastic surgery practice that has the device then a provider with more knowledge about different will be there to guide you. (Robert Whitfield, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting Applicator For Arms</strong></p><p>There is already an applicator that can work very well for the arms. However, not all practices may have this applicator. We’ve gotten great results treating the arms, but not everyone is a candidate for this treatment.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4250" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Make sure you see an experienced provider to determine whether the treatment is appropriate for you. We have never seen dents occur in the skin from CoolSculpting. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><p>We have had great results Coolsculpting the arms with the existing applicators. However, the patient needs to be the right candidate. Consult a board certified plastic surgeon for an evaluation to see if this is a good option for you. (Landon Pryor, MD, FACS, Rockford Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting is superficial treatment of the subcutaneous fatty tissue and should not interact with organs within andomen, unless you have a hernia and bowel was very close to the treated area. (Armen Kirakosyan, MD, FACOG, FACS, East Aurora Urogynecologist)</p><p><b>Coolsculpting and Cancer</b></p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4251" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I am not aware of any contraindication to having coolsculpting when there is past history of bladder cancer. I am also not aware of any way that fat elimination by cool sculpting would affect a cytology report. (Adam J. Mamelak, MD, Austin Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>This is something your oncologist should discuss with you and be aware of. Be sure to talk with your CoolSculpting provider about your health history so everyone can be on the same page.</p><p>Although CoolSculpting has minimal side effects, your body is still in healing mode. Get the OK from your oncologist before considering it. (Marguerite A. Germain, MD, Charleston Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Swelling after liposuction</strong></p><p>Liposuction leaves the tissue on the inside under the skin swollen and irritated. It also disrupts the drainage to the treated areas temporarily and this makes the areas feel more firm, swollen, and sometimes lumpy.</p><p>Most of the swelling is gone in the first 1-2 months, but it can take up to six months for all of the inflammation and swelling to go away. Massage can help the process go faster for you.</p><p>For best results, you should wait at least 6 months for all of the swelling to go away before having any more treatments. (Dana Coberly, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It would be very important to recover from your other procedure before being treated but you may benefit from treatment with the flap CoolSculpting applicator. (Robert Whitfield, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Is it typical to notice more fat above and below areas where cool sculpting was performed?</h5><p>Coolsculpting is a great technology and is effective where it has been applied. Therefore, it is not unusual to see your fat above and below the applicator was applied. Some patients have to have additional treatments to help smoothen additional areas of they are candidates.</p><p>It is best to discuss that with your board certified physician. (Himansu Shah, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Use two small coolsculpting adapters or one large adaptor for the treatment of stomach?</h5><p>Coolsculpting induces programmed cell death by selectively freezing fat cells. Because you do not have overly excessive adipose tissue in your abdomen, precise positioning of the smaller adapters will allow for better contouring as determined by your physician. (Suzanne Kim Doud Galli, MD, PhD, FACS, Washington Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting is done when you reach your desired weight. It helps you remove those stubborn fat bulges. Keep working on your body until you reach desired weight. After you have reached your goal, you can find experienced provider who will inform you about Coolsculpting and other procedures that can help you get rid of stubborn fat cells and sagging skin.</p><p>You can still proceed with Coolsculpting now but you may require more treatments since one treatment would remove around 25% of the fat cells. Even after coolsculpting treatment, you are advised to continue healthy lifestyle and exercise to prevent your body from forming fat cells again.
