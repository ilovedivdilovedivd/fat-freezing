<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><i>CoolMini Versus Kybella for Neck Fat</i></p><p>These are both completely different options for neck fat reduction. Both require a series of treatments for best results. Youd need a formal evaluation to see what you are a candidate for. Kybella is injected and can be contoured to your chin/jawline and neck area. Coolmini is a specific applicator that works over a small area to target localized fat. They both to some degree cause skin tightening as a secondry result. Please only see an expert to evaluate you.</p><p>Most often I find that patients chose liposuction which as only a 3 day downtime and can contour the neck completely in one treatment giving skin retraction and tightening but also contouring along the jawline. (Jason Emer, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)<br>

</div><h3>Coolsculpting CoolMini vs Kybella</h3><p>Coolsculpting CoolMini and Kybella are both good options to treat double chin fat (aka submental fullness). The CoolMini uses cold to cause fat cell destruction, while Kybella actually is injected and causes destruction of the fat cells by disrupting the fat cell protective wall (cell membrane).</p><p>I was one of the first physicians to offer Kybella after FDA approval and I have seen it achieve wonderful results. The active ingredient in Kybella has been studied for many years and it is very well characterized with clinical data from thousands of patients.</p><p>The CoolMini uses the proven technology of cryolipolysis which we know works based on the Coolsculpting devices other handpieces. Ultimately, I think both are very good options and which one I would use would depend on my patient’s preferences and individual situation. (Omar Ibrahimi, MD, PhD, Stamford Dermatologic Surgeon)<br>

</div><h3>Kybella provides better results</h3><p>Kybella continues to provide better results than CoolSculpting mini. In fact, we exclusively use Kybella in our office and I elected to receive Kybella injections. Kybella is the first and only FDA-approved injectable drug that contour and improves the appearance of submental fullness due to submental fat – or double chin.</p><p>Kybella is also more efficient as each in-office treatment only lasts 15-20 minutes. I suggest you consult a board certified facial plastic surgeon to receive the highest quality knowledge, treatment, care and skill available. </p><p>A consultation provides you the opportunity to relay your concerns and desired outcome to the surgeon while the surgeon can assess your health profile and discuss his/her pertinent advice.

<strong>Coolsculpting for jowls</strong><p>Coolsculpting can be very successfully used for the area under chin. The best way to determine if you are a candidate is to allow a certified professional evaluate your submental area. (Stephanie Martin, MD, Atlanta Orthopaedic Surgeon)</p><p>No it can not be done on the jowls. The applicator is sized to fit on the submental neck tissue and doesn’t fit onthe face above the jawline . Jowls are not just fat tissue either , they are a result of skin laxity and changes in bone structure & volume loss. (Drew Varano, MD, Washington DC Physician)</p><h5>Body Mass and CoolSculpting</h5><p>CoolSculpting is a body sculpting procedure and should not be thought of in terms fat percentages (or body mass as it is also referred to).</p><p>Some patients with excessively large treatment areas would be better candidates for plastic surgery. But, if you have some trouble areas that you want addressed I would recommend getting with your local CoolSculpting practice for an evaluation to see if this is the right procedure for you. (Michael P. Dunn, MD, Gilbert Physician)<br>

</div>
<b>Fat Percentage for CoolSculpting</b><p>It is not recommended to have a certain body fat percentage before doing CoolSculpting.  However, it is recommended to be at or near your goal weight to get the best results.  It is, also, best to be at a stable weight you can maintain to keep your results.</p><p> CoolSculpting is a cosmetic treatment and helps with body contour and the reduction of fat bulges.  It would be optimal to see a board certified plastic surgeon and a Certified CoolSculpting Specialist to see if you are a good candidate for CoolSculpting. (Jeffrey M. Hartog, DMD, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting treatments lead to permanent fat loss</i></p><p>The procedure can be done right after the another on the same day but I would stagger them 8-12 weeks. Each patient is different but treating the same area 3 weeks after will not give the best results. (Robert Whitfield, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div><h4>Don’t rush CoolSculpting</h4><p>It takes weeks for the treated fat cells to be eliminated by the body. Retreating earlier would not treat different cells because the same tissue would be drawn into the applicator.</p><p>The point behind waiting is so that remaining untreated fat cells now can be accessed by the applicator. You may see some additional discomfort (late onset nerve pain) from being treated in closer intervals. Please be careful and talk to other patients before having treatments closer together. (Vaishali B. Doolabh, MD, FACS, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Thyroid gland not at risk with Cool Mini applicator</b></p><p>The mini applicator should be placed in the upper neck and the thyroid gland is usually at the base of the neck.  The cold temperature does not spread a significant distance beyond the applicator, so happily, no real risk to the thyroid gland.<br>

</div>  Be sure to have your treatment by a graduate of Zeltiq’s Coolsculpting University so that everything is done to manufacturer’s recommendations. . (Vaishali B. Doolabh, MD, FACS, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)
<p><em>Coolmini treatment</em></p><p>When sculpting the chin area, if a client has an appropriate area of opportunity we may use two applications during the first session to slim the direct (frontal view) visual appearance(as your provider may have done).</p><p>The second session we most often use one applicator placed in a centered area to decrease volume to slim the profile (side view) appearance. Your results should be more visible after your second session. Discuss your concerns with your physician at your appointment tomorrow and answer any questions.</p><p>They will most likely take pictures to show your progress up to this point as well. (Jeffrey Hinton, MD, Johnson City OB-GYN)<br>

</div><h3>During CoolSculpting the cells are damaged, but it takes weeks for them to die.</h3><p>CoolSculpting takes weeks to have a final result. In fact, we recommend that our patients wait about 3 to 4 months to see their results. It will take two sessions to see optimal results as well, so don’t expect things right away. (Joel Schlessinger, MD, Omaha Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting Re-treatment</em></p><p>Re-treating the area with CoolSculpting whether it’s re-treated immediately after your first treatment that day or 4-6 weeks after your initial treatment, the benefits are for the overall outcome results. It will not speed up the process. (Ben Hugo, MD, Virginia Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Possible surgery after CoolSculpting for double chin</i></p><p>It is definitely possible to have a surgical lift done on the neck after having a CoolSculpting treatment for a double chin.  Just be sure to wait at least 12 weeks after your CoolSculpting procedure to see your final results before deciding if a lift is needed. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>If you feel like you still need surgery after Coolsculpting to your chin/neck area to improve skin laxity, there is nothing about Coolsculpting that will preclude you from having surgery.  This holds true for other areas of the body as well. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)
<p><strong>Chin lift after Coolsculpting</strong></p><p> The amount of loose skin and adipose tissue will determine if cervical liposuction (chin lift) vs a necklift or facelift is needed.</p><p>Remember that Coolsculpting is meant to debulk the fat. Whereas the lifting procedures address fat, muscle laxity as well as skin laxity. (Dominic Castellano, MD, Tampa Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting is a great treatment, and, does seem to give a more consistent treatment result, compared to Ultrashape. But, the Coolsculpting can’t be used on all areas, and, it does have some risks and potential side-effects the the Ultrashape doesn’t have.</p><p>So, if you want the most consistent improvement, and, you’re okay accepting a few possible side-effects/risks (and, you have an area that can be treated with Coolsculpting,) then, you might go with CS. If not, try the Ultrashape! We have BOTH, and, use them both, depending on the client, the area, and the situation :). (Lauren Chavez, MD, Albuquerque Physician)</p><h5>Coolsculpting vs sculpsure</h5><p>Coolsculpting has been used successfully for over 6 years in clinical practice and removes 22-24% of the subcutaneous fat, where as the FDA trials for sculpsure only show a 13% reduction. This information is presented in the last page of the attached link for the sculpsure FDA trial.” There was an average of 13% normalized fat reduction based on ultrasound measurements at 12 weeks”. (Drew Varano, MD, Washington DC Physician)</p><h5>Numbness following CoolSculpting</h5><p>It is not uncommon to have numbness or tingling in areas treated with CoolSculpting. In my experience, this tends to be more common in the outer thighs and with the CoolSmooth applicator. The numbness can last up to 4 weeks.</p><p>Fortunately, in my experience, this symptom always resolves completely with time. If you have concerns whether something is normal, it is always best to follow up with your provider for further evaluation. (Kent V. Hasen, MD, Naples Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Numbness post CoolSculpting procedure can last several days to several weeks. Generally speaking the areas of numbness are not totally numb and you will still have some sensation. Not all patients experience numbness but the ones that do consider it a small price to pay for a great result! (Lee B. Daniel, MD, Eugene Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
