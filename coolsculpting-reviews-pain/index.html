<span itemprop="articleBody"><p>&#8211; I&#8217;m in day 4 after flank and upper/lower abdominal coolsculpting all performed on the same day. I have swelling but no pain. I do have the pins and needle sensation but it&#8217;s exactly like I had after my tummy tuck years ago as the nerves sort of reactivate. It&#8217;s not irritating but rather I&#8217;m just aware of it. I feel it in the abdominal area only, nothing in flank area. I think the swelling and necessary/desired induced inflammation makes it feel funny but nothing painful. If you think about what body processes are causing these sensations it makes it much less bothersome. ð</p>
<p>&#8211; I had the coolsculpting procedure on my back in two areas. I had excess fat there and I wanted a smooth look when wearing shirts. All went well NO PAIN just a bit numb even at the 1 month mark.. I had my upper stomach done and OMG I am in the same discomfort as the rest of you. </p>
<p>Moving burning, itching and pain at the 1 wk mark. I hope it will go away real soon. If I had done the stomach first I would never have done the back. Interesting that there was such a difference&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8211; I had my Lower ab coolsculpting done 7 days ago. After the 1st day have been getting the stabbing, wasp sting pains pretty much 24/7. I am told that the lower ab treatment is the one where this is more likely to happen. It makes me worried that it is never going to stop!</p>
<p>&#8211; I had my upper abs and love handles treated on July 6, and had very little in the way of discomfort until day 3. From day 3 to 9, I was in a lot of pain and I have a very high pain threshhold. I could have called in for the lidocaine patches but did not and just tried ibuprofen, and I did get through it.</p>
<p>I will actually go in to have the procedure on my lower abs around the time of my first followup in September. I was told that I wouldnt really see any results until I passed week three, but I have had amazing results in just 2 weeks&#8211;before the procedure, I could pinch a roll that was like 3&#8243;, and now I can barely pinch an inch. I&#8217;m already back to wearing fitted tops without embarrassment. I guess my idea is &#8216;no pain, no loss&#8217;..lol</p>
<p>&#8211; I had cool sculpting done on my luv handles 6 days ago. I have had pain of varying degrees everyday. I am fairly fit, but seem to have accumulated fat around my middle that I can&#8217;t seem to diet or exercise off. I don&#8217;t generally bruise easily and did bruise quite a bit. I am still numb, have transient itching and dull to moderate pain all the time.</p>
<p>I am most frustrated that I seem to be bigger in the treatment areas than before! My skin/fat hangs over my clothes worse than ever!! When will I get back to the pre-op me??? &#8211;I know the fat destruction takes 2-3 months, but how long before I will be back to normal? I understand some inflammation is involved, but for how much longer? I wish someone at the doctor&#8217;s office had mentioned compression&#8230;I actually bought a girdle at a vintage store on the 4th day and it really helps with pain while I&#8217;m wearing it. I don&#8217;t wear it more than about 3-4 hours a day, as I am not sure if it will effect my circulation and healing. Can someone comment or answer me on these points?</p>
<p>&#8211; I had my cool sculpting procedure done 13 days ago and yesterday was the first day I felt good. I did have to ice my lower abdomen last night and today for just a few minutes. I did not call and get any pain killers instead I used ice to dull the pain. The doctors on here said it will not effect your results if you use ice. It got me though the pain. I hope to see some good results from all of this pain also. Really wish I had been told about the pain ahead of time and offered something for it. My doctor said only one person has ever called in for pain medication with the procedure. I find that hard to believe as this was really intense pain. If it is true then I must be the exception and part of the 2-5% they quote. Not sure who to believe after reading so many other posts about the pain. It seems to me if you do the abdomen you have the pain! I still have 3 more treatments in my purchase but not sure what to do. They recommend doing the same area two times to get good results.. Has anyone gotten good results with just one treatment? Also is the upper abdomen as painful as the lower abdomen? Any answers would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&#8211; I had my flanks and upper abs coolsculpting done Flanks, no issues, just numb. Upper abs, mild stinging, jabbing. Ice helped a lot, but didn&#8217;t really need anything more than that and it was infrequent. Having lower abs done in Feb. I think that area will definitely have more noticeable pain, but now that I know what to expect, I think it will be manageable. I believe a lot of people that have tons of pain have multiple areas done at once and I have also heard that if you have had a child, that area is more sensitive. It would be nice for the Doctors to give more information. Without this forum, I would have been more panicky.</p>
<p>&#8211; I have had great results with just one treatment! I had my lower abs done and was told I would need two. </p>
<p>That wasn&#8217;t the case. Instead I had my upper abs done because it worked so well I had a line where the machine stopped.</p>
<p>&#8211; I am a physician, I have had coolsculpting in my practice for 3 years now. When I first got the device, I had it done myself, I was one of the few who got terrible pain, immediately after (doubled over) and for days later as well. I can say that most my patients don&#8217;t experience that but it is common enough that I tell them to call for pain meds if needed. In my experience it is more common with the large hand piece and if someone has the pain with it then on the next treatment I use 2 small instead and that makes the pain virtually non existent or at least tolerable without meds. I never had pain when I treat the sides or back. Good luck,, don&#8217;t be afraid to go back.</p>
<p>&#8211; I am in horrible pain, had it done five days ago. Just one area, the lower abdomen costed $1,400.00. I am using ice and topical pain creme. What a nitemare.</p>
<p>&#8211; I am on my 5th day and the pain has been excruciating! I have a high tolerance to pain, but this is constant and really strong pain! I am tired and drained by the pain, no way you can go back to your normal activities when I cannot even get dressed because my stomach is so swollen that nothing fits! Everything is tender, on fire, constant stabbing, itching&#8230; Augh, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d recommend this to anyone&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8211; I experienced pain too. I even thought about taking time off from work. When I reported my pain I was prescribed some Lidoderm patches and acetamenophen pills with codeine so I could sleep better at night. I also wore my Spanx and massage the area for about 5-10 minutes. This helped me through the rough days. It&#8217;s important that you call your doctor or the center that performed your procedure.</p>
<p>&#8211; I had it done a year ago on abdomen and flanks. Only one time per area. I have no residual numbness or any odd sensations whatsoever. I&#8217;m not convinced that it did much for me but I guess it&#8217;s supposed to be a subtle difference&#8230; Like 20% of the fat from the area, so maybe it did more than I realize. Doing it a second time would likely help. So expensive tho!</p>
<p>&#8211; How long did the pain last? I am one week out now and experiencing the excrutiating pain that is hard to bear. It is true neuropathic pain&#8230;nerves have been injured during the procedure and are trying to regenerate. The problem is that this type of pain can lead to long term chronic pain syndromes, so I am interested on when you started feeling better.</p>
<p>&#8211; I&#8217;ve had different areas done and after the initial week or two of varying symptoms, I have not had any pain, numbness, etc. I have also had great results, especially in the upper abs!</p>
<p>&#8211; I was in pain from the second coolsculpting they sucked my stomach fat into that device.<br />
I had small stabbing pain for the first four days of recovery. The fifth day was horribly painful. I couldnt wear any bottoms. It felt hot .<br />
I took painkillers, used cold packs. And even the shower hurt the area.<br />
I dont recommend this procedure. I found it barberic.</p>
<p>&#8211; Had my second coolsculpting treatment on my lower abs 6 days ago? The pain during was the worst pain I have ever felt. Thought I was going to pass out and that lasted for 45 minutes. My upper abs are swollen and sore and that area was not treated. The pins and needles feeling that everyone describes is almost non existent not sure why I had so much pain during anyone else experience this?</p>
<p>&#8211; I had my coolsculpting done last night. I had my upper and lower stomach done. She started with the lower and I was under the impression that there was no pain! Omg! It hurt so bad, I went pale and got real clammy! I clenched the sides of the chair and almost made her stop. She told me to try and hold on for 10 more minuted then it will be numb. She also acted as if I was the only person that has ever complained! In fact it hurt to talk because talking made my stomach move!!! Anyways the pain did settle down a little and the upper was not as painful. I will not do it again because of the pain. I&#8217;m on day 2. She said my stomach will be numb for at least 3 or 4 days. It&#8217;s very tender!</p>
<p>&#8211; I had intense pain during,and for these 13 days after.<br />
Today its a little bit better. This is not a good procedure. I do not reccommend<br />
to anyone.</p>
<p>&#8211; I&#8217;m on day 3 or 4 and I only have a strange pain when someone bumps into me. I have been very cautious and I&#8217;m only wearing baggy clothes because my stomach feels really weird to the touch. Feels numb but I have some feeling. Strange feeling. My stomach is swollen to!</p>
<p>&#8211; I had my stomach done 6 days ago. I dont&#8217; have intense pain but I find that a &#8216;Spanx type panty has helped. it sort of pulls you in&#8230;it has lessened the discomfort. give it a try</p>
<p>&#8211; Its better tojoin a gym,eat well,drink water, and at least look at cute guys at a gym. I did all that for 7 months! Personal trainer and all!! Everything toned up except my Gut!!!!</p>
<p>&#8211; I&#8217;m on day 7 and my lower stomach is in severe pain! I have been putting cold ice packs on it but it hurts really bad! I hope there&#8217;s a difference. This procedure has beeway too painful</p>
<p>&#8211; i am on day 10 and still hurting. It started on Day 6. The pain comes and goes but mornings are usually better with increasing pain through the afternoon. I spent yesterday curled up in bed and hope it improves soon. I am not a whiner (broke my leg at the dog park last year and took no pain meds after Day 1). But this is constant pain that is wearing on me. I called for a pain med and they prescibed a low level vicodin which doesn&#8217;t seem to help. Hoping that the pain abates and that I see results.</p>
<p>&#8211; wish I had read all of these posts BEFORE I had my stomach done last week. Today is day 5 and I am in terrible pain. I have already told the office to cancel my second treatment&#8230;.I paid in advance and hope they will refund. Don&#8217;t recommend this to anyone.</p>
<p>&#8211; Ask for the nerve prescription and see if that helps you. I, too, was in horrible pain but the meds helped a ton. I was like you and thought it was too much to bear but after getting the meds and having good results, I changed my mind and went back (but this time with the prescription filled ahead of time.)</p>
<p>&#8211; Its been over a m onth since the procedure. I wish I had spent the money on an exercise bike or something. It was horribly painful,and I am embarrassed that I was stupid enough to do this. I don&#8217;t recommend it . Its a waste of money. You will feel like you got chumped!</p>
<p>&#8211; It seems the large applicator on the lower abs is the worse. I&#8217;ve all areas treated but with the smaller applicator and while a little discomfort, no big pain.</p>
<p>&#8211; I had my first treatment June 20th and experienced some tolerable discomfort after about four days and subsiding by my second treatment which was July 25th. The second procedure was a lot more painful during treatment but the after pain almost makes me sick to my stomach. It&#8217;s a constant feeling of heated needles pricking your muscles. I have a high tolerance to pain although if this goes on for three weeks I&#8217;ll be calling UNCLE.</p>
<p>&#8211; It has been 8 days for me and I still can&#8217;t sleep at night, the pain is pretty bad. I have been taking Neurontin for 2 days now and it has not helped.</p>
<p>&#8211; I had my sides done 4 months ago and there was no pain after, and just had my lower abs done 4 days ago and it is painful now. I have been told that the pain will last for about ten more days. Results from the sides were AMAZING. The pain is uncomfortable but bearable, lets hope it goes away soon.</p>
<p>&#8211; I had my sides done 4 months ago and it really worked,. I was a bit red for about a week but noi pain. Just had my lower abs done and it has been painful, it has only been 4 days so I will let you know how it goes.</p>
