<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Pain following Coolsculpting is rare but can be severe. Usually improves within a week. Contact your treating physician to have the correct medication prescribed. (Luca Russo, MD, MSc, London Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Pain after CoolSculpting</b></p><p>There really is no “painful aftermath” with a CoolSculpting treatment. </p><p>Most patients have no pain or discomfort with the treatment at all and get back to their regular activities immediately without any restrictions. </p><p>There are a rare amount of patients that have some discomfort with the procedure, however, this is variable based on each person’s tolerance for pain and discomfort.</p><p>A skillful physician or CoolSculpting technician can have an effect on the results that you get with the treatment, but not necessarily with the discomfort. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><h3>Coolsculpting and discomfort</h3><p>Coolsculpting is a great procedure for freezing the fat and reducing a bulge in a given area.  The majority of patients do not have any discomfort but it has nothing to do with the technician.</p><p> The abdominal area can be sensitive in some patients.  For the best cosmetic results please consult a board certified dermatologist with experience with Coolsculpting. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p>Pain/discomfort in the treatment area, starting at day 3-4 after your treatment, is normal. </p><p>Though it doesn’t always happen and doesn’t happen to most patients, it does happen. The pain generally lasts about 3-4 days.</p><p>Most people do just fine with ibuprofen but some need prescription medications or patches that you should contact your provider to discuss. Some people find that wearing compression garments (spanx, tights, etc) help a great deal.<br>

</div>Regardless of treatment or not for pain, it will resolve on its own. Make sure to follow up with the provider that performed your treatment so they can help you and follow your progress. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)
<h5>Pain During CoolSculpting</h5><p>The initial discomfort of the CoolSculpting procedure is because of the pressure used to suck the fat into the applicator. Lidocaine will not help this sensation. Taking ibuprofen or in severe cases an antianxiety pill such as Xanax about an hour before your treatment can help take the edge off a little bit.</p><p>The most effective remedy is the actual freezing of the fat, which as you stated makes you numb after 5-10 minutes. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)<br>

</div><h5>Treatment of pain during CoolSculpting</h5><p>When treating the abdomen with CoolSculpting, there is some discomfort when the applicator is initially placed. This normally resolves after about 5-10 minutes when the cooling process causes the area to become numb.</p><p>I do not think that topical lidocaine would help with this issue, as the lidocaine would only affect the outer layer of the skin and not the deeper layers underneath. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Is post procedure pain less on the love handles than the abdomen?</strong></p><p>Some people develop some pain after a CoolSculpting procedure while others do not.  It is possible that you could develop some pain after treating the love handles, but I would say that it is less likely to occur there than the abdomen. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)<br>
Sensation during/following the procedure may also vary depending on the area(s) treated. (James Silberzweig, MD, New York Radiologist)</p><p><b>Post coolsculpting pain</b></p><p>the pain is usually temporary but sometimes helped by warmth sometimes cooling, sometimes pressure and sometimes by neurontin or similar medications. (William H. Jervis, MD, FACS (in memoriam), Walnut Creek Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Post operative discomfort following Coolsculpting</h5><p>I am unaware of pain and tingling being associated with eating following Coolsculpting. It is unlikely. It is possible, however, to have discomfort , tingling, numbness or cramping after Coolsculpting this may last 4-6 weeks in some patients but unrelated to eating.</p><p>Typically this is well tolerated. (Steven Hacker, MD, West Palm Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Delayed nerve pain</h4><p> The delayed nerve pain should have nothing to do with the type of applicator used.  The choice of applicator is based on which applicator provides the best “fit” for the area to be treated.  You would not want to use an applicator that does not appropriately fit.<br>
 There are certain medications that can be used following the treatment to help with nerve pain.  Discuss with your practitioner. (Nicholas Tarola, MD, Nashville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>If the fat is pinchable the standard applicators are preferred. Now the new advantage applicators have less incidence of all the side effects so might be worth trying so that at least you get good cryolipolysis. (Ramandeep Sidhu, MD, Issaquah Vascular Surgeon)</p><h3>Patch for pain </h3><p>Lidoderm/lidocaine patches are used quite commonly for any pain that arises a few days after Coolsculpting.  They are very effective and will help you get over this bump in the road. Patients that do experience this and vow not to do more treatments are back right on schedule for more treatments because they are so pleased with their results. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)<br>
<em>Post procedure pain</em></p><p>It can be bad in rare circumstances. We typically prescribe Tramadol for pain, so you might ask you doctor about that. But don’t worry, the pain is temporary and the results permanent. (Guy Cappuccino, MD, Mount Airy Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>What over the counter medications can I take with Coolsculpting?</h4><p>If you are having tenderness after Coolsculpting, rest assured it will go away very quickly especially with the Cooladvantage applicators.  You are fine to take Tylenol and Advil, neither one will heal the frozen fat cells.</p><p> We recommend Aleve or Ibuprofen since it reduces more of the inflammation that is causing the tenderness. (Grace Liu, MD, Newport Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>You can take either tylenol or advil, either is fine.</h3><p>You can actually take either of those medications for pain control. Neither will interfere with the process of CoolSculpting. The treatment effects of CoolSculpting are unaffected by taking these medications.  (Garry K. Kim, MD, Pasadena Internist)</p><h5>Cryolipolysis side effects one day after treatment</h5><p>The FDA-approved device is CoolSculpting by Zeltiq. When CoolSculpting is performed, there normally is some temporary numbness to the treated areas that can last for several weeks.</p><p> Redness can occur but frequently is gone by the next day. Most people do not experience pain after the procedure, but there are a small percentage of people who can develop a pins and needles type of pain after treatment to the abdomen.<br>
(Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Is blood in urine a side effect of CoolSculpting?</em></p><p>Blood in the urine is not a side effect from CoolSculpting. I would seek further medical advice as to the cause of this problem. You could see your primary care doctor or a urologist. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)<br>
<strong>CoolSculpting Side Effects</strong></p><p>CoolSculpting is an absolutely wonderful treatment, but sometimes it can have some temporary side effects for up to two weeks. Blood in the urine is NOT a side effect from CoolSculpting. </p><p>I advise you to contact your primary care provider or OBGYN to investigate this problem further. (Peter J. Capizzi, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Is CoolSculpting safe with a copper IUD?</b></p><p>A CoolSculpting procedure on the lower abdomen would not affect the uterus or affect an IUD, whether it it copper or not. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Kidney function and Coolsculpting</h3><p>There is no additional strain placed on your kidney’s after Coolsculpting. The fat is metabolized through the usual fat metabolism and does not clear through the kidneys. Dr. Vosoghi. (Houman Vosoghi, MD, Los Angeles Physician)</p><p><b>Blistering After CoolSculpting</b></p><p>Bruising is can be seen after CoolSculpting but blistering is concerning and not a normal response. I would recommend you follow up with the treating office to be evaluated as soon as possible. Early intervention will offer the best chances of the irritated areas fully healing. (Scott Gerrish, DO, Vienna Physician)</p><h4>CoolSculpting: Post Treatment Concerns</h4><p>Having treated tens of thousands of patients with CoolSculpting, I can honestly say that we have never had even one person present with blisters post treatment.  This sounds very unusual, and would lead me to believe that your procedure was not performed correctly.</p><p>I would immediately contact your provider to have them take a look at this. And, I would also recommend a visit to a physician as well in order to have the additional opinion of a medical professional who was not directly involved in your CoolSculpting procedure.</p><p>It is not possible to make recommendations online without actually seeing you in person. (Edward Stokes, MD, West Hollywood Physician)</p></div>
