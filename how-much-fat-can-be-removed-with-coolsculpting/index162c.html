<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The average percentage of fat decrease in a CoolSculpting procedure is approximately 25 to 26%. I believe that this number is an average.</p><p>The more fibrous the fat, the less fat removed. It is only the fat cells and not the fibrous tissue that responds to the procedure. (Jeffrey Rapaport, MD, Englewood Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>The AVERAGE reduction in fat in one CoolSculpting session is 20%. That figure is provided by the company based on initial porcine (pig) studies, not humans. I am not aware of any detailed study on humans.</p><p>Remember an average is just that, there are results as low as 5% and as high as 35%, unfortunately, there is no way to predict that number.</p><p>That is why we usually recommend at least 2 or 3 treatments to achieve noticeable results. (David Finkle, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolSculpt results</em></p><p>The 20-25% is based on studies performed which measured fat reduction by MRI. We recommend all patients have 2 treatments to get the best results. Be sure your provider takes photos in a standardized way because it takes 3-6 months to see the full results and you may forget how you looked before!</p><p>Results vary, some patients see an obvious result within a couple of weeks and others see a more subtle result. (Patricia A. McGuire, MD, Saint Louis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Lipo vs CoolSculpting</i></p><p>Liposuction is the gold standard for fat removal as it allows for custom contouring and for removal of all the fat that needs to be removed.</p><p>CoolSculpting, on the other hand, is a nice alternative for someone who wants no surgery and no downtime, however it will only remove about 25% (on average) of the fat in the treatment area and it takes 1-3 months to see results.</p><p>Neither modality removes extra skin. Only a tummy tuck can do that. Please see an experienced plastic surgeon to discuss your options. (David P. Rapaport, MD, FACS, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Both coolsculpting and liposuction can be used for lower abdominal excess fat. It would be important to be evaluated by a board certified plastic surgeon who has performed a high volume of both to determine which procedure would serve you best.</p><p>Coolsculpting will not provide results if you are unable to pinch the fat away from the underlying tissues. The area also needs to be able to fit within one of the applicators, otherwise you would not be a candidate for coolsculpting.</p><p>Finally, it is important to note that neither Coolsculpting nor Liposuction will tighten the overlying skin if there is laxity.(Shareef Jandali, MD, Fairfield Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Non-Surgical vs Surgical </em></p><p>CoolSculpting is a non-surgical treatment that can eliminate pockets of fat in the abdomen, love handles, inner and outer thighs. Patients usually get 1-3 treatments in the same area over time because the treatment targets up to 20-25% of the fat cells.</p><p>A Mommy Makeover with liposuction is a very long case, but it will be better to sculpt all the areas that CoolSculpting may not be able to treat.</p><p>You are interested in many different procedures so it’s best to schedule a consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon.</p><p>You can learn about the non-surgical and surgical options that would give you the best results. (Robert G. Aycock, MD, FACS, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Number of Coolsculpting sessions required for results </i></p><p>Typically, appreciable Coolsculpting results require one to three applicator treatments to each area, spaced two to three months apart. Depending upon the patient’s anatomy, a particular area to be treated (i.e. lower abdomen) may require more than one applicator to treat the entire area, for example a patient may benefit from placing an applicator both above and below the belly button, each being a separate treatment.</p><p>The cost is per applicator treatment, however discounts are applied if a patient pays for a package of applicator treatments in advance. Because Coolsculpting is a noninvasive treatment (the fat is slowly broken down over time, not physically removed at the time of treatment), it can’t be used for fat transfer.</p><p>Fat transfer is only possible with liposuction. A visit to a plastic surgeon’s office will help you to understand if you’re a candidate for the procedure, and what aesthetic outcomes are realistic in your particular case.</p><p>In order to get a qualified, ethical, and expert opinion on your surgical options and expectations, always schedule an in-person office consultation with a plastic surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. (Keith M. Blechman, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>How Many CoolSculpting Treatments Are Needed </b></p><p>The cost of CoolSculpting is determined based on the number of areas being treated and the number of cycles needed. An in-person evaluation is needed to determine the cost. Don’t be tricked by offers that sound too good to be true.</p><p>A very low cost is usually a teaser price to get you in the door at which time you will learn your total investment is much higher. Cost can also vary from region to region.</p><p>CoolSculpting is a non-surgical treatment that essentially uses a device to freeze and destroy fat cells. These cells are then expelled naturally by your body. It can take 3-4 months for the entire process to take place.</p><p>More than one cycle/session to the treated area may be needed for the best result. Fat transfer can only be done by way of liposuction (surgical fat removal). Liposuction can be used to remove fat from the abdomen and love handles, and then transferred to the buttocks (a.k.a. Brazilian Butt Lift). A mommy makeover consists of a breast enhancement procedure (i.e. breast augmentation, breast lift, etc.) and a tummy tuck (with or without liposuction). Obviously the more procedures you have done, the more costly your investment.</p><p>However, combining as many procedures into one safe surgical setting ultimately becomes less expensive than doing them each individually. Remember, with surgical procedures you have the surgeon’s fee, surgical center fee, anesthesiologist fee, etc. I would highly discourage you from basing your decision on what can be done as “cheaply as possible.”</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4078" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I recommend you seek out a qualified provider for an in-person evaluation so you can begin learning what options are best suited for your goals. (Vinay Aggarwal, MD, Los Angeles Physician)</p><p><b>How many CoolSculpting sessions does one need per treated area?</b></p><p>If there is still enough pinchable fat then you may benefit from another round of CoolSculpting. This will certainly give you better results. I recommend seeing a CoolSculpting certified clinic for a proper in-person consultation and treatment plan. (Alain Michon, MD, Ottawa Physician)</p><p>With each CS treatment you will lose approximately 25% of the fat in that area, so it really depends on what you started with and what you are hoping to achieve.</p><p>If you are unsure of your results, I’d suggest being evaluated by another physician who is a certified CS provider. (Michael Kerin, MD, New Rochelle Physician)</p><p>Here are some general tips: make sure that your Coolsculpting provider is Coolsculpting certified.</p><p>Just because they have the machine does not make them qualified to assess and treat you — it’s a sculpting procedure and if the fat isn’t removed appropriately, it can leave you worse off. Also, see if your provider has advanced training in Coolsculpting from the “Coolsculpting University” course.</p><p>This course provides techniques beyond that which any other provider receives upon getting their machine. (Parker A. Velargo, MD, New Orleans Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Coolsculpting or Sculpsure</h5><p>Coolsculpting and Sculpsure are two great treatment options for fat reduction. Coolscupting is the most popular non invasive treatment platform to get rid of stubborn fat worldwide because it is effective and with barely any downtime.</p><p>Other type of skin tightening or skin smoothing treatments can easily be added to Coolsculpting for optimal results. I recommend consulting with a Coolsculpting certified practice. (Alain Michon, MD, Ottawa Physician)</p></div>
