<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Yes Coolsculpting is FDA-cleared for the treatment of visible fat bulges on the inner and outer thighs as long as you are a candidate for this procedure. (Jessica Glenn, MD, Howell Family Physician)</p><p><b>Inner and outer thighs</b></p><p>For the right patient with focal areas of fat on the inner and outer thighs, CoolSculpting can be a very effective treatment!</p><p>The CoolFit applicator is commonly used for the inner thigh, and the CoolSmooth applicator can be applied to the outer thigh.</p><p>In fact in can be so effective, that Zeltiq, the maker of CoolSculpting, suggests waiting a full 90 days after the first treatment before considering additional cycles.</p><p>For other body sites, an additional treatment may be recommended as early as four weeks after the first.</p><p>If you are considering treatment, you should find an experienced plastic surgery practice for a consultation. (Larry Lickstein, MD, Fairfax Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Coolsculpting works well on the inner thighs and outer thighs</i></p><p>We have been utilizing the Coolfit applicator for the inner thighs and the Coolsmooth applicator of the outer thighs. Both work extremely well and we have had excellent results. I highly recommend them both.</p><p>For the best results and to see if you are a good candidate please consult with a board certified dermatologist whose practice has been certified by Coolsculpting. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p><strong>There is a special CoolSculpting applicator specifically designed for use on the thighs</strong></p><p>Yes, there is a special CoolSculpting applicator specifically designed for use on the inner and outer thighs. As long as you are an appropriate candidate, CoolSculpting can provide a 20-30% average reduction of fat on the inner thighs.</p><p>Please see a board-certified dermatologist for a consultation to make sure that you are a good candidate for this treatment. (Sabrina Fabi, MD, San Diego Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting for Inner Thighs</i></p><p>CoolSculpting of the inner as well as outer thighs is very common treatable area.</p><p>The limiting factor is you must have enough tissue to draw into the applicator. With sufficient tissue draw great results can be achieved.</p><p>In my practice I have been getting great results with the inner thigh area using CoolSculpting. During your consultation your Board Certified Plastic Surgeon will be able to assess the area and determine if you are the ideal candidate. (Cynthia L. Mizgala, MD, Metairie Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>CoolSculpting Reduces Fat on Inner Thighs</strong></p><p>CoolSculpting is an excellent fat reduction procedure for the inner thighs. In fact, there is an applicator designed for just that purpose so it fits snugly on the thigh. Inner thighs are common trouble areas where fat tends to accumulate, even on individuals who lead healthy lifestyles.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_443" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You can target the inner thigh alone or also treat the outer thigh. Find an experienced CoolSculpting provider to get the most out of your treatment. (Katherine A. Orlick, MD, Tucson Dermatologist)</p><h3>CoolSculpting on the inner thighs</h3><p>There is an applicator now that works very well on most patients who are interested in treating the inner thighs. It is called CoolFit, and some practices have purchased it. You sound as though you may be a very good candidate, especially because you do not have excess fat on the outer thighs.</p><p>I hope you find a practitioner with the CoolFit applicator and have a consultation. (Sheryl D. Clark, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h3>CoolSculpting Works On Inner Thighs</h3><p>This is very common in a lot of the patients I see. Inner thigh fat can be genetic, but may appear during menopause or just because of general weight gain. Previously, this type of fat was treated with liposuction, which involves wearing support garments and longer downtime.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_444" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>A non-surgical alternative to liposuction is a cryolipolysis treatment, such as Coolsculpting. This is a fat freezing treatment, that is approved by the U. S Food & Drug Administration for many areas, including FDA approval for inner and outer thighs.</p><p>Coolsculpting can freeze the fat by only targeting the inner thigh area without affecting the outer thighs, this is because of a specifically designed applicator to treat this area. The fat freezing cools the target area, which kills the fat cells.</p><p>These treated cells then cystallise (freeze) then shrivel and die, over the coming weeks; your body metabolises them and disposes of them naturally. This gives long term results. Without the downtime associated with surgery. (Tracy Mountford, MBBS, London Physician)</p><p><i>CooLSculpting to Thighs</i></p><p>Because we are a coolsculpting certified office our specialists have all been to CoolSculpting University and can find the right applicator to work on your problem area. Getting the specific treatment regimen that is right for you is what sets us apart. (Delio Ortegon, MD, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_445" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><em>Coolsculpting for the inner and outer thighs</em></p><p>The short answer is yes Coolsculpting is FDA approved for treatment of the inner and outer thighs and it can be quite effective if you are a good candidate. The dimension of the inner thigh fat must be such that it fits to the shape of the Coolsculpting applicator.</p><p>This is the biggest limitation for treating the inner and outer thighs with Coolsculpting. In order to determine this it is important to seek out an expert Coolsculpting practice and have a consultation/examination to assess your particular situation. (Paul Flashner, MD, Boston Physician)</p><h5>Does CoolSculpting work on inner and outer thighs?</h5><p>Yes, CoolSculpting works on inner and outer thighs using an FDA approved applicator that is specifically designed to treat fat cells on the inner thigh. Fat on the inner thigh is notoriously difficult to reduce through diet and exercise alone, and excellent results have been observed in this area, providing you meet the criteria necessary to be considered a good candidate.</p><p>I would recommend you schedule a clinical assessment with a CoolSculpting provider to explore your options. (Jia Zheng, MD, Vancouver Physician)</p><h5>Treating the thighs</h5><p>Cool Sculpting is a great non-invasive technique to eliminate stubborn fat. Generally speaking, our patients see a 20-25% reduction in fat per round of treatment. Depending on how much fat you need to reduce in the area, a second round of treatment may be necessary. The procedure is quite comfortable and there is no downtime required! (Bradley Bengtson, MD, FACS, Grand Rapids Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>CoolSculpting for Inner Thighs </b></p><p>Yes, CoolSculpting is a wonderful fat removal treatment for the thighs! It is necessary to have an in-person consultation to ensure your are a good candidate.</p><p>The amount of fat present and skin quality are two primary factors that need to be evaluated.</p><p>The wonderful thing about CoolSculpting is that it is completely non-invasive with no downtime, and the fat destroyed during the treatment is permanently removed. When seeking a provider be sure they are certified by Zeltiq, the manufacturer of the device.</p><p>This ensures advanced training has been obtained. (Vinay Aggarwal, MD, Los Angeles Physician)</p><p><b>CoolSculpting and CoolSmooth Can Eliminate Inner-Thigh Fat</b></p><p>CoolSculpting works by freezing the fat cells and killing them without adversely affecting any of the other skin, tissue or muscle in the area.</p><p>Until fairly recently, you needed to have a “pinchable” amount of fat of about 1 to 2 inches so that it could be sucked up between the two cooling plates on the CoolSculpting applicator.</p><p>However, a new applicator called CoolSmooth has now become available. If the fat is too thin for pinching, the CoolSmooth applicator is simply run over the area to be treated. I would need to see you in person to determine which applicator is best for your inner thighs.</p><p>Of note, you may also want to be treated with CoolAdvantage – which uses a lower temperature than CoolSculpting and cuts treatment time by about 45%. Therefore, a session that used to take 60 minutes now takes about 35 minutes.</p><p>Reach out to a board-certified dermatologist to learn more about your options. (Melda A. Isaac, MD, Washington DC Dermatologic Surgeon)</p></div>
