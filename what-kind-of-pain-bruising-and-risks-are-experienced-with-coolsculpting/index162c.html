<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>With any new procedure, one should fully understand all the risks associated to determine whether the selected treatment is the right one for them.</p><p>As for Coolsculpting by Zeltiq, this procedure boasts one of the highest safety ratings vs other devices, mainly because there is no surgery, no cutting, no anesthesia, which is why it’s a great option for so many people struggling with that last bit of fat that will not respond to diet and exercise. Here are a few things you should know, and consider, before treating with Coolsculpting.</p><h4>Does Coolsculpting hurt?</h4><p>If you are very sensitive, we would highly recommend treating ONLY with the new CoolAdvantage Coolsculpting family of Applicators. These applicators provide comfort during and after treatment, almost to the point where patients say they feel no sensation whatsoever! The original applicators, when applied to areas like the abdomen, did provide an uncomfortable sensation due to the suction of tissue into the applicator.</p><h4>What are the risks from Coolsculpting?</h4><p>Two main (most common) risks to consider are: pain post treatment, typically experienced when treating the abdomen areas, and sometimes the outer thighs, and much more rare is freezer burn, where the treated area will have a very slight discoloration (this does fully resolve and treatment can be accelerated).</p><h4>Is there bruising with Coolsculpting?</h4><p>Typically yes when using the original applicators, and typically no with the newest CoolAdvantage family of applicators. The bruising is mainly a function of the suction, and with the original applicators that had a small opening and longer base, the tissue would have to be pulled harder to fit in the applicator, thus causing the bruising.</p><h4>Can suction be controlled with Coolsculpting?</h4><p>Again, if you are very sensitive, we would highly recommend treating only with CoolAdvantage family of applicators as these provide comfort during and after treatment.</p><h4>Is the Bigger suction more painful than using 2 smaller suctions for the stomach?</h4><p>Here you are referring to the Coolmax vs Cool Core, applicators designed for the abdomen areas. The large applicator is a massive applicator that treats a bigger section of fat compared to the two smaller ones, this one covers 2.5x the amount of coverage of one small applicator and is the choice applicator is the positioning of the fat tissue requires it.</p><p>This applicator upon treatment onset does draw in a lot of tissue and thus the pain that is experiences is from the suction. Now, we would absolutely recommend the CoolAdvantage Plus applicator as many client remark NO PAIN whatsoever with this maximum applicator.</p><h4>Coolsculpting Pre/post treatment care?</h4><p>Luckily, Coolsculpting is a very low maintenance treatment option that does not really require much after care. A few things to note, however, many of our patients remark that ice packs and light massage while driving, in the shower, etc, help to with bringing circulation to the area.</p><h4>How long has Coolsculpting been being used in the states?</h4><p>About 10 years. (Edward Stokes, MD, West Hollywood Physician)</p><p><strong>Zeltiq Coolsculpting is a safe effective way to reduce fat with minimal if any discomfort</strong></p><p>The temperature used to freeze the fat during the Zeltiq Coolsculpting procedure is standardized. It is based on the size and shape of the applicator which determines the time and temperature needed to freeze the targeted fat cells into crystals.</p><p>Those crystals are then broken up either by manual massage or using a Zimmer Zwave radiowave device. The applicators used for any given patient are based on the areas of fat to be treated. The original applicators required significant suction between two cold plates.</p><p>The newer cooladvantage handpieces require less suction because the sides and top are cold plates. The coolsmoothpro designed for the outer thighs has no suction. In general more suction means more post procedure swelling and bruising.</p><p>In fact, the cooladvantage handpieces may leave almost no sign of treatment immediately after. Discomfort is usually minimal — the area can feel sore in the 5 to 10 minutes afterward as it defrosts. Later patients may take acetaminophen or ibuprofen.</p><p>Rarely a patient experiences more significant discomfort. After ruling out other causes, it can be treated with a medication like neurontin or lyrica. The pain is thought to be from temporary inflammation of the nerves.</p><p>However, there haven’t been any cases of nerve damage with coolsculpting. About two weeks after treatment the area may feel itchy in the area which can be treated if needed with moisturizers and orl antihistamines.</p><p>Otherwise no special care is needed and patients go right back to normal life activitities after treatment. Your physician and her staff will choose the applicators that are best for you depending on your anatomy and the locations and sizes of the fat areas to be treated, Coolsculpting is the most widely used noninvasive fat reduction system in the world with over 3 million cycles of treatment performed worldwide and more peer reviewed journal articles confirming its safety and efficacy than any other. (Heidi A. Waldorf, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h5>Does Coolsculpting Hurt?</h5><p>Coolsculpting is a non-invasive treatment with no downtime. It is possible to have bruising on the area treated from the suction that is applied. With the new CoolAdvantage applicators there have been no reports of late onset nerve pain.</p><p>They have also been designed to be more comfortable during and after treatment for patients. (Kathleen Morno, MD, Highland Park Physician)</p><h4>Coolsculpting and pain, risks</h4><p>Now with the new applicators we are noticing very little bruising and pain. Most patients complain of some numbness during the first 5mins of the treatment, then it pretty much resolves. Some of have some soreness at the treatment area site which goes away after 4-5 days.</p><p>It should not cause nerve damage. It is non-invasive, very well tolerated, without any side effects except for some mild bruising and soreness in a small percentage of patients. (Shamim Shakibai, MD, Los Angeles Physician)</p><h4>Coolsculpting experience</h4><p>Coolsculpting is tolerated fine by many, yes it can cause minimal bruising and minimal soreness. in rare cases tingling and burning sensation that may stay few days to weeks however there is medication to calm that feeling.</p><p>it does work and every time it is applied you can expect 20-25% response. (Parham Gharagozlou, MD, FACP, Walnut Creek Physician)</p><h4>Pain, Bruising and Risks with CoolSculpting</h4><p>CoolSculpting is one of the easiest and safest procedures to have for non invasive permanent fat reduction, and is FDA approved. We have provided over 2000 treatments and I have been treated myself as well as almost all staff members.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_594" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a0f55035236d15bcd767dbaeacd668cb">

</div><p>The most discomfort (and I use the word discomfort, not pain) is in the first few minutes of “freezing” and then when the applicator is removed and the massage is done. The discomfort is rather tolerable and most people don’t even have this.</p><p>The feeling for up to a few weeks after treatment could be a numb, itchy feeling to the area treated. We suggest Arnica pellets and gel or cream to the area before and after treatment.</p><p>The CoolMax larger handpiece could have more discomfort because twice the area is being treated and therefore felt more. On rare occasions there could be nerve pain in which a medication in prescribed (Neurontin), which alleviates this and which sub ides in a short amount of time. (Emerico Csepanyi, MD, Newport Beach Physician)</p><p>Every patient is different in terms of pain response and side effects during and after. It is not uncommon to have some bruising, swelling, and pain due to temporary nerve injury. The pain can start several days after the treatment and continue for a number of days after that.</p><p>Medication can be used to help with the pain.
