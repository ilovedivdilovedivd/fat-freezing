<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>CoolSculpting is not a weight loss procedure, it is a body contouring procedure.</p><p>More important than your actual weight is whether or not you are within 10-15% of your ideal body weight.</p><p>Those are the individuals in which the treatment works best for.</p><p>The best thing to do is get an in-person consultation from an experienced physician in your area.</p><p>They can do an assessment to see if you are a suitable candidate for the treatment and how much you would need to give you the best result. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting is for patients who have localized areas of fat they want removed or for contouring. Weight has nothing to do with it. (Jason Emer, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting is a safe method to contour the body and reduce abdominal fat. In one of the largest studies done on CoolSculpting, patients saw as much as a 23% reduction in abdominal fat thickness three months after the procedure.</p><p>This procedure should be planned together with a diet and excercise regimen, discussed with your physician, to achieve and maintain excellent results. (Jill C. Fichtel, MD, Columbus Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Weight for CoolSculpting</strong></p><p>Weight is not the overall question for CoolSculpting, but obviously those with more weight will need more treatments and probably with multiple “applicators” to get the fat down. The concept “if you can grab it, you can treat it” is what we always say for CoolSculpting; so you need to have a consultation with a reputable person, a board-certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon, and see if you are a proper candidate for this procedure.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3919" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In any event, this will not replace diet and exercise, so this also must be brought into the equation and needed for a good outcome. (Michael Gold, MD, Nashville Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Will CoolSculpting result in weight loss?</i></p><p>CoolSculpting is a non-invasive method of fat reduction to isolated areas of the body. It is not a weight loss treatment and normally does not lead to weight loss. Ideal candidates are people who are not overweight who have isolated areas of fat that do not go away with diet and exercise. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting Is Not A Weight Loss Procedure</em></p><p>CoolSculpting is not a weight loss procedure, it is a body contouring procedure. With each treatment you can expect an average of 20-25% reduction in fat, however, your weight will often stay the same. If you are looking for a weight loss procedure then CoolSculpting is not for you. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3920" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Coolsculpting selectively freezes fat cells to induce programmed cell death. There is no weight cut off, per se. It depends on the location of fat and if the tissue can be pulled into the applicator.</p><p>You may benefit from an in person evaluation by a physician that performs coolsculpting. (Suzanne Kim Doud Galli, MD, PhD, FACS, Washington Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting is a great way to reduce body fat, while being non-invasive. The amount of Coolsculpting required would vary based on the goals of each patient. Coolsculpting/Allergan recommends treating each area a minimum of 2 time to get the best results.</p><p>Coolsculpting is very effective when coupled with a healthy diet low in processed foods. Limiting carbohydrates and eating lean protein are also great ways to take weight off along with good old fashioned exercise. (Richard Ruff, DDS, Zanesville Dentist)</p><p>CoolSculpting does help to reduce back fat but it is ideally suited for individuals who are at or near their ideal body weight. CoolSculpting can help to reduce isolated areas of unwanted fat in these patients. I would recommend weight loss before undergoing CoolSculpting. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting is not a weight loss procedure. It is effective for fat reduction when done in multiple regional treatments. We usually weigh patients at each appointment to make sure that they have not gained weight since this will change the result. (Elisa A. Burgess, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting can be used while losing weight to spot reduce areas. Because of the effects, the skin contraction takes place over time resulting in some tissue “tightening”. Coolsculpting will usually not result in irregularities if the applicators are placed appropriately.</p><p>Make sure to lose weight the right way and slowly with good nutrition and exercise. Seek out a Board Certified Dermatologist or Plastic Surgeon who performs coolscuplting for an honest opinion. Be wary of the hard-sell, medspa type establishments. (Kyle Coleman, MD, New Orleans Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting works best when your body mass index is below 30, I prefer patients bmi to be 27 or below .</p><p>If your height is smaller than 6.0 ft your bmi is above 36 . Coolsculpting would not be recommended and a diet program should be your first step. (Drew Varano, MD, Washington DC Physician)</p><p>Coolsculpting will enhance your weight loss results and if done properly will not result in lumpy skin or unflattering results. Seek out a provider in your area that does lots of coolsculpting so you can be sure he/she is experienced and will have the guts to turn you away if it won’t benefit you. (Justin Harper, MD, Columbus Physician)</p><p>CoolSculpting has the best scientific evidence. We have been doing CoolSculpting at our office for over 6 years and have helped patients achieve great results. The results are permanent and long lasting if you maintain a healthy lifestyle after treatments.</p><p>You do have to be a good candidate for CoolSculpting (ie, have pinchable fat), so it is best to have a consultation with an expert. (Lesley Loss, MD, Rochester Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>For mild areas of fat excess Coolsulpting can be a great option, but the distribution of your fat is very important, as well as skin quality and underlyting muscle. (Stacey Folk, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The ideal patient for body contouring is a good weight for their height but has areas of that which will not go away. Surgical and nonsurgical methods of fat removal can help you meet your goals.</p><p>I would advise a consultation with a surgeon in your area who offers all options to be sure you can get your best result. (Terrence Murphy, MD, Englewood Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Coolsculpting after baby.</h4><p>Coolsculpting is a great permanent fat reduction procedure for stubborn areas of fat. But keep in mind it is not a skin tightening percedure. My best advice is that you find a local Coolsculpting professional and get a 1 on 1 body assessment, so they can determine if Coolsculpting can meet your goals. (Brian Young, DO, Saint Clair Shores Physician)</p><h3>Loose Skin After Childbirth</h3><p>Coolsculpting will not fix the loose skin that you have on your abdomen. You will likely need a tummy tuck. Do all your weight loss first by whatever method works for you. If you don’t know a good method, take animal fats, starches and complex carbs out of your diet and eat “clean”.<br>
Or find a physician near you who can help you reshape your body with 6 weeks on the hCG Diet Protocol and then have a tummy tuck and you then can expect a pretty amazing result. (Deborah Ekstrom, MD, Worcester Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>If the problem is fat only, the lipo and or CS should work, but if there’s loose skin or loose muscle, the TTYL would be a better procedure if you want to be flat. Without an exam, it will not be possible to fully evaluate you and give you recommendations.</p><p>Be sure to discuss your goals and concerns with your board certified plastic surgeon and consider the pros and the cons. Be certain your surgeon is properly certified. (Reza Momeni, MD FACS, Summit Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
