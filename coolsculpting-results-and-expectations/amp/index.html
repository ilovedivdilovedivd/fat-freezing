<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>When it comes to CoolSculpting, it sometimes takes a couple of sessions to get optimal results, which can be appreciated about 90 days after the procedure. While CoolSculpting is a safe and effective procedure for the right patient, it isn’t for everyone.</p><p>In my experience, it is most effective when used on the abdomen and thighs. In a large study done on CoolSculpting, patients saw up to 23% reduction in abdominal fat thickness 90 days after the procedure. However, an in-person consultation is the best way to determine if you’d be a good candidate for this treatment. (Jill C. Fichtel, MD, Columbus Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>coolsculpting selectively freezes fat cells to induce programmed cell death. Whether or not you are a good candidate can be determined only by physical examination. (Suzanne Kim Doud Galli, MD, PhD, FACS, Washington Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4162" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-df427de03e6a63b36d5a3a614ab89371">

</div><h4>CoolSculpting is amazingly effective for permanent fat reduction.</h4><p>We have been doing CoolSculpting for several years and with hundreds of patients happy (including myself and many of my staff) I can assure you that it works, is only mildly uncomfortable for most and does not have any serious risks.</p><p>Age is not a factor in results or problems. Because CoolSculpting actually kills fat cells safely and fat cells do not regenerate you can expect permanent fat reduction. If you need more results than a 25% reduction in fat then more than one procedure can be done.</p><p>The most important factor in obtaining the best results is the initial evaluation and plan from your physician. (Susan Van Dyke, MD, Paradise Valley Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>How soon will I appreciated results from CoolSculpting</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4163" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-c5a320fa69312d561fc6cd54de925dff">

</div><p>I tell my patients that they may not appreciate results till 6-8 weeks post treatment. When you follow up with your provider around at 8 weeks they’ll likely take photos to document the results.</p><p>If there is reduction and you feel there needs to be more then you can choose to have a second treatment. The results following CoolSculpting aren’t noticeable immediately nor do you see daily changes. My first suggestion is to stop looking and measuring daily, this is a waste of your time and only adds to your anxiety. (Oscar A. Aguirre, MD, FPMRS, FACOG, Denver Urogynecologist)</p><p><em>How long does it take to see results from CoolSculpting?</em></p><p>Do not be discouraged although some patients can see results as early as three weeks the most dramatic results will be seen somewhere between the second to fourth month after treatment.</p><p>In fact I have had a patient return after two months and having shown little improvement and then only to come back after four months and shown impressive results.</p><p>Remember with CoolSculpting we are freezing the fat which causes the body to remove the fat in a natural metabolic process. Because everybody metabolizes things differently the fat will be cleared by the body at different rates depending upon the metabolic processes of the individual. (Ted Brezel, MD, Long Island Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>No Results One Month After Zeltiq, Too Soon to Worry?</i></p><p>I’m hearing/seeing more and more patients being dissatisfied with the “ZELTIQ” therapy. I have never offered this therapy because I was not fully convinced it gave reproducible results.</p><p>Your options are:</p><p>1. Live with it, and/or seek other more invasive treatments or do nothing,<br>
2. Ask for a secondary therapy session,<br>
3. Request a refund (doubtful to get anything back). (Darryl J. Blinski, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>CoolSculpting results in 90 days.</h4><p>What we find in most of our patients is that it truly does take a full 90 days to see your complete results. Some patients do start seeing some difference at about 4 weeks but not everyone.</p><p>The majority of our patients are satisfied with just one treatment but you can see more in the 40% up reduction range with a second treatment. We have seen wonderful results with CoolSculpting so do not be discouraged. (Frederick Lester, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Timing for CoolSculpting Results</b></p><p>It is not unusual to have swelling for the first month after CoolSculpting treatment. Everyone varies in her response, but fat loss should be evident at 60 days, with final and noticeable results at 90 days after treatment.</p><p>I would suggest that you not take measurements daily, but instead do so no more often than weekly. (Roby F. Hayes, MD, Portland Physician)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4166" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p><b>Optimal Timing Between Procedures Coolsculpting NYC</b></p><p>The optimal timing between procedures really depends on how much of a bulge there is and what you are treating. The original studies with Coolsculpting repeated these procedures after one month. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h4>Coolsculpting vs. surgery for optimal abdominal correction</h4><p>loose skin that overhangs at the level of your bellybutton & lower down–does not tighten with Coolsculpting.</p><p>Coolsculpting does provide about a 20% reduction in the thickness of fat under the skin with each applicator cycle–however, if that is not the major contributor to your abdominal fulness, then its reduction will make minimal improvements overall.</p><p>A physical examination would be necessary to know for sure, the pictures are just a guide. Please contact your CS provider with your concerns and see if they have any additional suggestions. (Vaishali B. Doolabh, MD, FACS, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4167" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><b>Redness and numbness</b></p><p>Redness usually subsides in a short time after treatment. Bruising is not common but may occur and I expect this might happen to you. If so, it should resolve in a few weeks. Tingling and numbness are common and should slowly improve. (Martin Everhard, MD, PhD, Savannah General Surgeon)</p><p><b>Placement of applicator</b></p><p>The application should be applied in the area of highest volume of fat. It is very common for us to have asymmetry between our right and left sides and often are bulges are not equal as well.</p><p>It is possible that your right and left bulges are different. It takes several weeks for the results to be noticed. In the meantime I would suggest massage the area. (Helena Guarda, MD, Suffolk Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It can take up to three months to see the final results from Coolsculpting. At one week out you cannot judge whether Coolsculpting was effective or not. You can definitely receive liposuction and a tummy tuck after Coolsculpting if you are not satisfied with your results. (Landon Pryor, MD, FACS, Rockford Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Drinking Alcohol — CoolSculpting Results</h5><p>Drinking limited amounts of alcoholic beverages will not influence your CoolSculpting results, yet — via alcohol — you are consuming extra calories on a daily basis. Remember that if you are trying to reduce the amount of fat in a particular area of your body, calorie counting can help! Our most successful patients are the ones who watch their caloric intake, drink lots of water and exercise regularly. (Barry M. Weintraub, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How soon to see results after coolsculpting treatments ?</h3><p>You should have seen results usually 8-12 weeks after the initial treatment. I strongly recommend following up with the clinic for before and after pictures, and possibly having more cycles done to your stomach.</p><p>On average, more than one cycle is needed per area for optimal results. (Alain Michon, MD, Ottawa Physician)</p><p><b>CoolSculpting expectations</b></p><p>Noticeable and final results will take place between 3 and 6 months. Generally I recommend 2 treatments 8 weeks apart for optimal results.</p><p>I would recommend you return to your treating provider and see if you can proceed with another set of treatments. This may end up getting you closer to your goals. (Oscar A. Aguirre, MD, FPMRS, FACOG, Denver Urogynecologist)</p><p><b>CoolSculpting Results</b></p><p>Although most people start seeing improvement in 3-4 weeks, it can take up to 3 months to see full results. Have you had before and after pictures compared? Sometimes patients don’t notice results themselves but they are clearly evident on the before and after pictures.</p><p>If you don’t see results after 3 months then you probably weren’t a good candidate to begin with. Your pooch may be more loose skin than fat. Make sure you follow up with your doctor and discuss your concerns. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><h3>30 days post Coolsculpting</h3><p>Typically it takes the body 30-90 days to metabolize the dead fat cells. In some cases patients have reported seeing further response up to 5 months post treatment.</p><p>The patients we’ve treated over the last several years have been very pleased with the results of their Coolsculpting treatment and typically see the peak of their results at 90 days. Certain areas such as upper arms and inner thighs have been reported to respond much faster at 30 days but that is not typical. (Christopher Assad, MD, BSc, FRCSC, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>No results seen 2 months after CoolSculpting to submental area</em></p><p>I would say that results normally can be seen as soon as one month after CoolSculpting but this can take as long as 3-4 months to see the full effect. You may want to wait another month to see if there is any improvement to your submental area.</p><p>It is helpful to examine pictures of you before the treatment and after the treatment to judge results. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Some patients do see results starting as soon as 4 weeks, but typically full results are seen at 3-4 months. I would wait another 4 weeks and then go into the treating office and ask them to do after photos.</p><p>You can then compare your before and after photos to see your results.
