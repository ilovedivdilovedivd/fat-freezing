<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h5>Pain is not a direct correlation to results</h5><p>Not having pain does not mean the treatment will not work for you. Pain is not necessarily correlated to the predicted results you will get. Different areas will experience different levels of discomfort (or not) and different people will have different experiences based on pain tolerance as well. (Maiysha Clairborne, MD, Atlanta Family Physician)</p><p>Most patients tolerate the CoolSculpting procedure well. It is not common to have pain after the procedure. </p><p>The fact that you have no pain does not predict anything about your results. Expect to start seeing some results at the 1 month mark and peak results at the 3 month mark. (Shaun Patel, MD, Miami Physician)<br>
<i>Pain does not mean results</i></p><p>Don’t be concerned about the absence of pain with CoolSculpting. The procedure is minimally invasive, and does not require pain to be effective. (Stephen J. Ronan, MD, FACS, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Most patients do not have any pain after CoolSculpting and the presence or absence of pain after the treatment is not indicative of the final result.  Be happy that you did not have any pain afterwards and wait 3-4 months to see your full result. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting does not require pain in order to eliminate fat cells! Keep, in mind every ones pain tolerance is different.  </p><p>CoolSculpting is consider the “lunch time” procedure, do to the fact that there is if any, minimal discomfort associated with the treatment.<br>
Follow up with your treatment facility to schedule “after” pictures, to really gage your results. (Keith Durante, MD, FACS, New York General Surgeon)</p><h3>CoolSculpting is often pain free</h3><p>CoolSculpting can cause the types of *shock* pains you were expecting, most commonly on the belly, rarely on the flanks. But it does not happen in all patients, only some. And, the new cooladvantage applicators have a lower incidence of this delayed onset pain.</p><p>I am also excited to say that as one of the 7 centers across the country to be given the opportunity to work with the new fabulous CooladvantagePlus, I can tell you the fabulous results can happen with even less discomfort than before.</p><p>No delayed onset pain does not mean no results. It does mean the CoolSculpting process is great; effective and comfortable. (Elizabeth Slass Lee, MD, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)<br>
<strong>No Pain with Cooladvantage</strong></p><p>Cool-advantage is the latest technology from Coolsculpt. The advantages are that it treats the fat in a 3D cup with cooler temperatures and has a shorter treatment time as well as much less post -treatment pain. Do not worry that you are not having the same pain as with the original treatments; That is normal. (Quenby Erickson, DO, FAAD, FACMS, Chicago Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Worried because I had no pain or side effects after Coolsculpting</h4><p>This is the norm for most people. I wouldn’t worry at all. Your results should be normal. The Cooladvantage and Zimmer Z Wave when added give less side effects and better results. Realself tends to get the people that have more side effects vs the ones that glide right through the procedure. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>CoolAdvantage CoolSculpting for less pain and discomfort</h4><p>The CoolAdvantage treatments more evenly distribute the cooling process of the skin-fat bulge. It therefore provides a faster cooling cycle and we hear more and more that patients experience less discomfort. This does not mean you won’t have sharp pain or dull discomfort following any CoolSculpting treatment, even with the new or older applicators.</p><p>Mild swelling and very occasionally bruising does indicate a proper treatment session and I suspect you will have the desired effects of fat reduction. (Dean P. Kane, MD, FACS, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Coolsculpting selectively freezes fat cells to induce programmed cell death. It is not a painful procedure for most patients. And pain can be a variable experience between different indivuals. You should see a result in the next one to three months.<br>
Give yourself some time to say the effects. If there are concerns after one to three months, please follow up with your doctor. (Suzanne Kim Doud Galli, MD, PhD, FACS, Washington Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Coolsculpting and pain</h4><p>The amount of pain during or after the treatment does not directly correlate with the results. Give it a few months to see the full effect of the treatment on your body. (Michelle Ellern, DO, Livingston Physician)</p><p>Pain and swelling after Coolsculpting can be variable to the individual. The absence of pain doesn’t mean it wasn’t performed correctly. It will be a few months until your final results.  (Jason Emer, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Discomfort after Coolsculpting usually occurs right after the procedure. It is very normal to have no pain the next day. There are some delayed pain syndromes after Coolsculpting but they are very rare. (Lawrence Broder, MD, Cedar Park Family Physician)<br>
Each patient has a different experience with Coolsculpting during and after the procedure. In my practice your situation is more common than having significant pain afterwards. Your amount of discomfort should not correlate with whether or not you see results. (Sanjiv Kayastha, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Does CoolSculpting have to hurt to be effective?</h5><p>Everyone responds differently to CoolSculpting. Pain is not an indicator of success or failure of the treatment. Enjoy your easy recovery. (Carmen Kavali, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Pain and Coolsculpting</b></p><p>Although many patients feel pain or numbness during or after CoolSculpting, it is not necessary in order to produce results. Results depend upon how cold you get the fat and I am assuming the applicators were placed properly and the temperatures achieved were correct.<br>
Results will take 2-3 months to see. (Andrew B. Menkes, MD, Mountain View Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>The amount of discomfort varies with each patient. Many patients claim they have felt very little pain. The fact that you had no discomfort doesn’t have any correlation to the degree of your results.  (Miguel Delgado, MD, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The perception of pain and discomfort during CoolSculpting vary from person to person. Some people have no discomfort at all whereas others may have discomfort that is above average. Neither of these correspond to whether you will get results from the treatment or not.</p><p>If it turns out that you don’t see any results after your treatment it will likely be because using one small applicator alone was not enough to give you a good result. (Michael A. Zadeh, MD, FACS, Sherman Oaks General Surgeon)</p><p>After a few moments of the applicator in place, most patients report that they feel little or nothing in terms of pain or even sometimes a cold sensation. I would not expect that your lack of significant sensation will affect your result. (G. Robert Meger, MD, Phoenix Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>CoolSculpting pain vs. results</b></p><p>The amount of discomfort varies with each patient and doesn’t have any correlation to the degree of your results. (Steven Gabel, MD, FACS, Portland Hair Restoration Surgeon)</p><h4>Coolsculpting results</h4><p>Not everyone bruises and not everyone experiences substantial pain that gets a good result. However, that being said you want to make sure you were assessed and evaluated by a well trained physician to make sure you are a good candidate for the procedure and that they have expertise in the procedure for optimal results. (Omar Ibrahimi, MD, PhD, Stamford Dermatologic Surgeon)</p></div>
